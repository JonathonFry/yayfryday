>pear and frangipane tart&lt;/a>), I found a recipe for orange and almond cake. A pretty simple cake and with a boost of vitamin c from the oranges it&amp;rsquo;s almost healthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used the BBC Food&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/orangecake_83870" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>orange and almond cake recipe&lt;/a>. The recipe starts with boiling some oranges in a pan, which left the kitchen smelling divine, and then blitzing them up whole.&lt;/p>

It has been months since I last baked something. I think the colder, darker evenings are encouraging me to get back to it and get the oven on. I fancied something with fruit, but also something that Jon would also enjoy so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t eat the whole thing myself right after I made it. Pears were a safe bet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed the Hairy Biker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/pear_frangipane_18911" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pear Frangipane Recipe&lt;/a>. I realised as I was rolling the dough my flan tin is a couple inches smaller in diameter than the one in the recipe, which meant I had to cut off quite a lot of pastry and I could only fit two out of three pears on top. I managed to fit all the frangipane filling in it though (phew), but meant I also had to cook it for longer as it&amp;rsquo;s super thick.&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ll drink it occasionally if we have some made up or if we&amp;rsquo;re in a coffee shop, but generally I&amp;rsquo;d make a green tea if I&amp;rsquo;m having a hot drink. To be honest it&amp;rsquo;s probably because of my laziness as I find green tea the easiest and quickest to make. But I do love a good coffee cake, especially the coffee flavoured buttercream icing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a craving for that coffee icing and so after I rummaged through the cupboards I decided to get baking. A quick google search landed me with Nigella&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nigella.com/recipes/coffee-and-walnut-layer-cake" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Coffee and Walnut Layer Cake&lt;/a> recipe that I used as a base. I made some amendments to Nigella&amp;rsquo;s recipe based on the ingredients I had (eg replaced butter with coconut oil) and also chose to make cupcakes, simply because I find them easier to make and to eat (plus they are faster to bake ;)).&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sponge was delicious and the icing was just what I was looking for - great flavours with a good amount of coffee. I froze half of them and took some out of the freezer to defrost a few weeks later and they were just as good, the nuts still crunchy and the sponge still moist.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coffee and Walnut Cupcakes (makes 18):&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Sponge:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>50g walnut pieces&lt;/li>
&lt;li>225g caster sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>225g coconut oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g plain flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4tsp instant espresso powder (I used Illy Classic Roast Ground Coffee)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2.5tsp baking powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>0.5tsp bicarbonate of soda&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 large eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1-2tbsp milk&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Buttercream Frosting:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>230g icing sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>115g soft unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5tsp instant espresso powder (dissolved in 2/3tbsp boiling water)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>walnut pieces to decorate&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Method:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 170Â°C and line a cupcake tray with 18 cupcake cases. I had to bake these in two batches as I only have one tray.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a food processor blitz together the walnut pieces and sugar to a powder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the butter, flour, espresso powder, baking powder, bicarb and eggs and process to a smooth batter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the milk and combine to loosen the cake mixture. It should be a soft dropping consistency, so add more milk if needed. (If you are making this by hand, bash the nuts to a powder with a rolling pin and mix with the dry ingredients; then cream the butter and sugar together, and beat in some dry ingredients and eggs alternately and, finally, the milk.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divide the mixture between the cupcake cases and bake in the oven for around 18 minutes, or until the sponge has risen and feels springy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool the cupcakes on a wire rack, and once cool you can make the buttercream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a food processor (or by hand using a wooden spoon), mix the icing sugar with the butter to make a smooth icing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dissolve the instant expresso powder in the boiling water and add it to the processor and blend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spread the icing on top of the cupcakes and top with the walnut pieces.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

I was given Madeleine Shaw&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Get-Glow-Delicious-Recipes-Nourish/dp/140915744X/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Get The Glow&lt;/a> book for Christmas, where she talks about ditching sugar completely and the health benefits in doing so. We saw it as a good challenge which would also be good for our health. The day we decided to do it we checked the food we had and made sure none of it contained added sugar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as difficult as I thought it would be to cut out. Green tea with lemon and Nakd bars kept any cravings away, and it felt good to not have sugar crashes. Plus both of us were doing it so we could encourage each other and make sure we didn&amp;rsquo;t slip up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After our wedding we&amp;rsquo;ve been eating sugar (lots of wedding cake and champagne started it off), though we don&amp;rsquo;t drink squash or eat cereal anymore and still snack on Nakd bars. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will completely cut out sugar again right now, I will aim to cut it out the majority of the time and save it for special occasions only (eg birthday cakes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I baked lemon cupcakes with pistachios as a weekend treat from Get The Glow. They contain honey as a sugar substitute and I chose to use coconut oil as the fat. I followed the recipe but they came out a little dark on top so I think for my oven the temperature could be lowered. The cupcakes are delicious with the zing from the lemon and the crunchy pistachios, and super easy to bake.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a tin of pumpkin puree in my cupboard for quite some time, knowing that at some point I would bake something with it. Then a copy of olive magazine came through my door. I spotted the pumpkin pie spiced muffins recipe and knew instantly that was what I would bake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are so tasty and the sponge is lovely and moist. The spice isn&amp;rsquo;t too overpowering either (which I was worried about), it&amp;rsquo;s nice and subtle. I only iced 6 of the muffins and I like the non iced ones just as much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still have half a tin of the pumpkin puree left, so I&amp;rsquo;m keeping my eye out for another recipe. Or perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to make these again ;)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pumpkin pie spiced muffins from Olive magazine (Nov 2014). Makes 12.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>300g self-raising flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tsp pumpkin pie spice*&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp baking powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g light muscovado sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>250ml sunflower oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g pumpkin puree&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Frosting:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>125g butter, soft&lt;/li>
&lt;li>50g icing sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a pinch pumpkin pie spice*&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g cream cheese&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Heat the oven to 180C/Fan 160C/gas 4. Line 12 muffin tins with cases. Sift the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and sugar in to a bowl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mix the oil, eggs and pumpkin puree together. Fold this into the dry mixture (don&amp;rsquo;t overmix, a few lumps are fine). Divide the mixture into the muffin cases and bake for 35 minutes or until cooked. Cool the muffins on a wire rack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To make the frosting, beat the butter with the icing sugar and spice, then beat in the cream cheese.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pipe or spread the frosting onto the cooled muffins and sprinkle on a little extra spice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>*&lt;em>Pumpkin pie spice: you can make this by mixing 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg &amp;amp; allspice.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: Stuck to the recipe. The dough was really wet which made it quite hard to knead. They were &amp;lsquo;baked&amp;rsquo; in a frying pan on the hob.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: I eat english muffins quite a lot for breakfast (straight from the freezer to the toaster) so I thought they&amp;rsquo;d be a good choice, plus they&amp;rsquo;re a bit different since they aren&amp;rsquo;t baked in the oven. They taste good and Jon and I ate them for our weekday breakfasts with nutella or toasted with butter. The texture was slightly different to the shop bought muffins, they were more airy which I think was because of the wet dough.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a quiet weekend. I spent almost all of Saturday in my kitchen (with plenty of cups of tea) whilst the rain poured down. I was waiting in for an IKEA delivery, and when it came Jon and I put together a desk that now sits in the back of our kitchen. Then I did some baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tarte au citron is something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try to bake. I love lemon in cakes (see &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/07/04/iced-lemon-drizzle-cupcakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>here&lt;/a>) so it was about time I used them in a tart. I followed Mary Berry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/tarte_au_citron_94480" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tarte au citron&lt;/a> recipe almost exactly (I made the pastry by hand rather than by food processor). The recipe was much simpler than I thought it would be, and the result is so tasty. There&amp;rsquo;s a perfect amount of zing from the lemons. I think it would be just as good with a bit less sugar though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the first Mary Berry recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, (no idea how I managed that) I must test out some more!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I last did some baking, but since the new season of The Great British Bake Off has started I&amp;rsquo;ve been inspired to get back at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating a lot of blueberries this summer. Finally a berry that Jon will also eat and enjoy! We&amp;rsquo;ve been taking blueberries to work with us and eating them with breakfast too. I thought it was about time I baked with them so I bought a bag of frozen berries so that they&amp;rsquo;d be there ready for me when I needed them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I baked blueberry muffins because I love blueberry muffins. Also I don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad about having them for breakfast because they contain fruit and they are a breakfasty thing. Just pretend I didn&amp;rsquo;t put that crumble topping on top.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: I replaced the 300g bread flour stated in the recipe with 225g &amp;lsquo;00&amp;rsquo; flour and 75g finely ground semolina flour (thanks for the tip &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/recipe/pizza-dough" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>Review: It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple years since I&amp;rsquo;ve made pizza from scratch, and although it&amp;rsquo;s not a typical &amp;lsquo;bread&amp;rsquo; I think the base counts! The pizza turned out really good, flavours were great and the only thing I think that would improve it is if I had a pizza stone and stretched the dough a little thinner.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Woah it&amp;rsquo;s been a while&amp;hellip; Jon and I moved in to our new flat almost 2 weeks ago and we&amp;rsquo;ve only just had the internet installed at the weekend. But hooray we are all settled in and have a long list of TV shows to catch up on! We both love our new place, the kitchen is so big and we made the most of it over the weekend when we had a flat warming - I baked ciabattas and we cooked tapas. And I made these cheesecakes. They were delicious. We had to fight over the last piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to make baked cheesecake for a while, and had a little look around for recipes and stumbled across &lt;a href="http://apumpkinandaprincess.com/2012/08/mini-snickers-cheesecakes.html" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> recipe for baked snickers cheesecakes (I totally copied the caramel sauce and chopped up snickers on top). I adapted it a little and made 2 versions (both with snickers) - Oreo base and Philadelphia, and Digestive base and Cadbury Philadelphia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t decide on my favourite&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/10/mini-baked-snickers-cheesecakes-2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997" alt="mini baked snickers cheesecakes (2)" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/10/mini-baked-snickers-cheesecakes-2.jpg" width="490" height="685" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I made them both:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mini Snickers Cheesecakes with Oreo Base&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(makes 6)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1/2 cup Oreos&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5 tbsp melted unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 egg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 snickers bar, chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>130g cream cheese&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp vanilla&lt;/li>
&lt;li>optional: caramel sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
1) Â Preheat oven to 175C and line a muffin tray with 6 cupcake liners.
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Crush Oreos and mix with melted butter. Place 1 heaped tbsp in to each liner and flatten down to the bottom of the cases. Place muffin tray in the fridge whilst making the filling.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mix cream cheese and sugar together. Add the egg and vanilla, mixing until smooth. Fold in 1/2 the chopped snickers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fill the cupcake cups with the filling. Bake in the oven for 22 mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leave to cool completely (they sink down after a few minutes out of the oven). Remove the liners carefully, and top with the caramel sauce and the other 1/2 of the chopped snickers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mini Snickers Cheesecakes with Cadbury Philadelphia &lt;/strong>&lt;em>(makes 6)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1/2 cup digestives&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5 tbsp melted unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 egg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 snickers bar, chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>130g Cadbury Philadelphia&lt;/li>
&lt;li>optional: caramel sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Notes: I was a bit scared of making bagels, with the boiling stage and shaping them I thought something would probably go wrong along the way.

&lt;p>This morning I baked these cookies and now there are only 2 leftover&amp;hellip; so I think that means they were a success! Double chocolate cookies are so good - the more chocolate the better. Especially when the cookies are chewy and soft and crisp on the outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I halved the recipe to make 10 so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel too guilty if they got eaten quickly (although now I wish I made more). So here&amp;rsquo;s the recipe below, which I advise you don&amp;rsquo;t halve ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/09/doublechoccookie2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1960" alt="doublechoccookie2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/09/doublechoccookie2.jpg" width="490" height="366" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>125g butter, melted//100g light brown soft sugar//125g caster sugar//1 egg//1 tsp vanilla extract//175g self-raising flour//50g cocoa powder//Â½ tsp salt//200g chocolate&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C/gas mark 4.
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Put the melted butter in a bowl (to melt it I microwave my butter in the bowl) and stir together with the brown sugar and caster sugar&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Combine with the egg and vanilla extract&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add the flour, cocoa powder and salt and mix it all together until it becomes doughy&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Chop up the chocolate (I use Dairy Milk) and mix it in to the cookie dough&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Divide the cookie dough in to 20 evenly sized pieces and place on to trays lined with baking paper. Place the trays in the oven for 7-8 minutes. The cookies may not look cooked but they will stiffen as they cool. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to overcook them if you like them chewy inside. Leave them to cool on a wire rack, and enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today I baked these yummy iced lemon drizzle cupcakes as I had some lemons that needed using. I had roughly 115g of caster sugar left so I used that amount to judge how much other ingredients to use. I forgot that I&amp;rsquo;d need some more caster sugar for the drizzle but I used soft brown sugar instead and it tastes just as good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1903" alt="ldcupcake2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake2.jpg" width="490" height="323" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made 9 cupcakes from the mixture, and had a bit of icing leftover. I also threw in a handful of poppy seeds which adds a bit of texture. The sponge is lovely and moist, and the icing makes them that little bit more special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1901" alt="ldcupcake3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake3.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the sponge:
115g caster sugar
115g self-raising flour
115g butter, softened
2 eggs
zest 1 lemon
handful of poppy seeds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the drizzle:
juice 1 lemon
60g brown sugar&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the icing:
zest and juice of 1 lemon
200g icing sugar&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Preheat oven to 160C. Beat together the butter and caster sugar until creamy, then slowly stir the eggs in one at a time. Add the flour, lemon zest and poppy seeds and mix together. Place the mixture in 9 cupcake cases and bake in the oven for 30mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make the lemon drizzle by mixing together the lemon and sugar. When the cupcakes are baked, remove them from the oven and prick them with a fork. Then spoon the drizzle over each cupcake and leave to cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once cooled, make the icing by combining the lemon zest and juice with the icing sugar until smooth. Pour over the cupcakes and leave to set. Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I brought some fresh home grown mint back from Poland, thanks to Natalie&amp;rsquo;s mum, and decided to use it to make these cookies. Mint choc chip is one of my favourite flavours, and is usually my first choice when choosing ice-cream.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The dough made 14 regular cookies and I used the left overs (which would make 6 regular cookies) to make a giant cookie which I baked in a cake tin. I flattened it down in the pan with my knuckles to speed up the cooking time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/bigmintcookiedough.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1812" alt="bigmintcookiedough" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/bigmintcookiedough.jpg" width="490" height="412" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then cook for around 8mins, adding a couple more minutes for the larger one, and they&amp;rsquo;re done. They are super chewy and so tasty. I love the fresh taste of the mint with the dark chocolate, half of them have already been eaten..&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On the weekend I fancied something sweet and spotted a baked doughnut recipe from &lt;a href="http://www.krissys-creations.com/2011/06/baked-doughnuts.html" target="_blank">Krissy&amp;rsquo;s Creations&lt;/a>Â on Pinterest. Since I already had all the ingredients I went ahead and baked them. I&amp;rsquo;ve never made any type of doughnut before, but these were pretty easy to make and a lot healthier than fried ones. The doughnut holes remind me of mini iced buns!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/bakeddoughnut.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1653" alt="bakeddoughnut" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/bakeddoughnut.jpg" width="490" height="696" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much like fried doughnuts in taste and texture, but they&amp;rsquo;re tasty regardless! And I think they look pretty cute too :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. I used a 2 inch and 3.5 inch round cutter to make the doughnut shapes and kept to &lt;a href="http://www.krissys-creations.com/2011/06/baked-doughnuts.html" target="_blank">the recipe&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chewy Chocolate Toffee Waffle Cookies</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/chewy-chocolate-toffee-waffle-cookies/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 23:32:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/chewy-chocolate-toffee-waffle-cookies/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cwcookie.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1610" alt="cwcookie" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cwcookie.jpg" width="490" height="360" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thank Jon for these cookies. We went to Lidl yesterday to grab some pizza, and whenever we&amp;rsquo;re in Lidl a pack of toffee waffles (also called caramel wafers) always seem to end up in our shopping. They are so good and the added cinnamon flavour in these ones make them even better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cw.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1608" alt="cw" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cw.jpg" width="490" height="343" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make chocolate and toffee cookies for a while now, and Jon suggested using the toffee waffles. Today I made them, and oh are they good! They are sooo chewy and I love how the caramel oozes out from the waffles, and with the dairy milk, well they&amp;rsquo;re certainly full of sugar! I halved my &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2012/05/31/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/" target="_blank">Chewy âMillieâs Cookie Styleâ Cookies recipe&lt;/a>Â to make the cookie dough, and used 2 broken up waffles and around 15 blocks of dairy milk (I cut each block in half), and managed to make 12 cookies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cwcookie2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1609" alt="cwcookie2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cwcookie2.jpg" width="490" height="710" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last week whilst at university, there was a lady outside the student shop with a table filled with plates of cookies, flapjacks and muffins. She was giving them away for free to promote some new products they were launching in the shop. So I picked up a muffin, I had no idea what it was but it looked good. It turned out to be a lemon and poppy seed muffin and it was delicious! So I wanted to recreate that flavour, but instead of muffins I chose to make cupcakes with lemon buttercream icing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1556" alt="lemonpoppy2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy2.jpg" width="490" height="693" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed the BBC GoodFood&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/470636/lemon-and-poppyseed-cupcakes" target="_blank">lemon and poppyseed cupcakes recipe&lt;/a>Â to make 12 cupcakes, although I halved the icing quantity (so glad I did!) but still used the juice of one lemon. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t bother toasting the poppy seeds, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what difference that would make? The end result is yummy nevertheless! I love the texture with the poppy seeds and the zing of lemon is so good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think they would still be tasty without the icing if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something with less sugar (and butter!) or maybe instead of buttercream making a lemon drizzle topping instead.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never baked a treacle tart before. In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever baked any kind of tart. I received a &lt;a href="http://www.kitchencraft.co.uk/catalogue/detail.aspx?pid=17967&amp;amp;gid=41192&amp;amp;pg=5ulcAD71%2bPexhaYfvBsz%2fHT6rBVSpj1j" target="_blank">loose base fluted tin&lt;/a> for Christmas that I&amp;rsquo;d been wishing for, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to make any kind of tart, flan, or quiche since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which brings me to this week and my first attempt - Treacle Tart from Lorraine Pascal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943/ref=cm_cmu_pg_t" target="_blank">Baking Made Easy&lt;/a>. Treacle Tart is something me and Jon both really enjoy, it&amp;rsquo;s old-fashioned and super easy to make. It&amp;rsquo;s great straight from the oven with vanilla ice-cream, and I love how the top came out a little bit chewy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/treacletart2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1504" alt="treacletart2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/treacletart2.jpg" width="490" height="627" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>500 g sweet shortcrust pastry (I made mine from scratch or you can use shop-bought)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>450 g golden syrup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zest and juice of 1 lemon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>60 g butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tsp ground ginger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>250 g breadcrumbs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
[ordered_list style="decimal"]
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Get the oven on to 180Â°C. Roll out the pastry to about 3 mm thick and line the tart tin. Prick the base lightly with a fork and place in the fridge for around 20 mins to firm it up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the pastry case from the fridge. Take a piece of baking paper and cover the pastry. Fill it with baking beans or dried beans (I used lentils) and 'blind bake' in the oven for 15-20 mins. The edges should be lightly coloured and the base dry to the touch. Remove the beans and paper and return the pastry to the oven for 5 mins, until golden.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To make the filling, put the golden syrup, lemon zest and juice, butter and ground ginger into a large pan and melt gently over a low heat. Stir in the breadcrumbs, then pour the mixture into the pastry case and bake for 20-25 mins, until lightly browned and set.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
[/ordered_list]
&lt;p>Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday I baked myself a birthday cake. I was really in the mood to bake something and it was my birthday the next day so I thought why not! It&amp;rsquo;s oh so chocolatey and delicious, just the way I like :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did cheat and buy a box mix (Betty Crocker&amp;rsquo;sÂ &lt;a href="http://www.bettycrocker.co.uk/Our-Products/Cake-Mixes/Devils-Food-Cake" target="_blank">Devil&amp;rsquo;s Food Cake&lt;/a>) because I wanted to give it a go and be a bit lazy. But I did make the frosting from scratch and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing! I followed the recipe for nutella cloud frosting from &lt;a href="http://sweetapolita.com/2012/03/chocolate-birthday-cupcakes-with-nutella-cloud-frosting/" target="_blank">Sweetapolita&lt;/a>, and it really does have an airy cloud-like texture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s see how long this cake will last&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: I made 12 breadsticks as stated in the recipe, each 25cm long. I shaped half of them into twists and used chilli salt, black pepper, poppy seeds and sea salt as toppings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: They&amp;rsquo;re great for dipping, but I found them quite chewy on their own. I also would have preferred them to be thinner, perhaps by dividing the dough into more sticks or making extra long ones. The chilli salt ones were my favourite.&lt;/p>

As others have also commented on the recipe, the bread did go brown quite quickly so I covered with foil and turned down the heat to 210C halfway through. As well as a serrated knife I also need a really sharp knife or a razor blade to score the loaf properly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: I liked that it used a &amp;lsquo;squidge&amp;rsquo; of honey rather than any sugar.Â After 10mins the loaf had already coloured as much as I wanted it to go so I covered the top with foil to stop it going any darker.

&lt;p>Review: Lovely soft bread that tastes as good as a plain white loaf can. Great with butter or nutella, &lt;em>especially when it&amp;rsquo;s still warm&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>{Â I chose this bread as my first loaf for its simplicity. I figured if there&amp;rsquo;s no disasters with this then I can go ahead with my plan to bake 15 different breads by 2013. So here goes!}&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cinnamon Breakfast Muffins</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/cinnamon-breakfast-muffins/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2012 13:14:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/cinnamon-breakfast-muffins/</guid><description>&lt;p>A couple days ago I was searching the web for a new breakfast recipe. I make pancakes most Saturdays and felt like something different this weekend. That&amp;rsquo;s when I found &lt;a href="http://velvetlava.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/i-am-now-in-muffin-loop.html" target="_blank">this recipe&lt;/a>Â via pinterest, and they sounded so good especially as me and Jon both love cinnamon (I wish we had a Cinnabon in Edinburgh).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These muffins are AMAZING. Like melt-in-your-mouth sugary deliciousness. They&amp;rsquo;re like doughnut holes and would go down very nicely with a hot cup of coffee.Â Just don&amp;rsquo;t eat too many at once, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of sugar in there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/muffins.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1157" title="muffins" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/muffins.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="364" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are so simple to make too [&lt;a href="http://velvetlava.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/i-am-now-in-muffin-loop.html" target="_blank">Here&amp;rsquo;s the recipe again in case you missed it&lt;/a>]. I had all of the ingredients (minus nutmeg which I replaced with a teeny bit more cinnamon) in my cupboard. I think I would only make half of the coating next time, I still have loads left over which I&amp;rsquo;ll save for whenever I want to use cinnamon sugar instead of regular. I also made 4 in cases and just dipped the top in, just so I can store them easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how they looked after they came out of the oven before I coated them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/beforesugar.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1158" title="beforesugar" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/beforesugar.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="314" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And here they are in all of their sugary-goodness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/muffins2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1159" title="muffins2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/muffins2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1014" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have to make these muffins. Seriously. &lt;em>Do it right now.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

When it was on TV (over 2 years ago it finished!) me and Jon were both hooked. And I admit I was a bit overly hooked; I was on the forums speculating theories and all. I know sometimes it did go a bit crazy and there were so many questions to be answered, but it was the characters that I loved about it. It&amp;rsquo;s one of my favourite TV shows along with The Shield, and the reasons for both are because of the characters and how much I cared about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now we&amp;rsquo;ve just started to watch it all over again! I baked some cookies using my &lt;a title="Chewy âMillieâs Cookie Styleâ Cookies" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/">go-to recipe&lt;/a>, and decided to quickly ice some of them with a Lost theme. Yep one had the numbers on, and another with the dharma logo. Too cool ha.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They were as yummy as ever, and we pretty much ate them all whilst watching 5 episodes of the show. Although I think we got through most of them in the first episode&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Were you a Lost fan? Love/Hate the ending?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I did some more baking, but this time I had to pop to the shop to pick up 2 lemons. I baked a lovely lemon drizzle cake. It&amp;rsquo;s my first attempt at this cake and I was happy with the result - although I think there was a bit too much mix in my loaf tin as it went HUGE, so next time I&amp;rsquo;ll either scale down the ingredients or do the loaf as well as some little cupcakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how it was made..&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/lemondrizzle.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976" title="lemondrizzle" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/lemondrizzle.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="785" />&lt;/a>&lt;em>225g unsalted butter//310g caster sugar//4 eggs//2 lemons//225g self-raising flour&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
Here is the recipe I followed viaÂ &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4942/lemon-drizzle-cake">BBC Good Food&lt;/a>Â &lt;em>(my changes in bold)&lt;/em>:
&lt;blockquote>Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Beat together 225g softened unsalted butter and 225g caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add 4 eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through. Sift in 225g flour, then add the finely grated zest of &lt;strong>1.5 lemons&lt;/strong> and mix until well combined. Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.
&lt;p>Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the juice of &lt;strong>2 lemons&lt;/strong> and 85g caster sugar to make the drizzle. Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle - the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping. Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.&lt;/blockquote>
The cake was lovely and moist, but the top was definitely the best part ;)&lt;/p>

And here&amp;rsquo;s what I ended up with&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/souffle.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906" title="souffle" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/souffle.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="734" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;chocolate soufflÃ©s!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followedÂ &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4351/chocolate-souffls" target="_blank">this recipe&lt;/a>Â from BBC GoodFood, but used 1/3 of the ingredients to serve 2. I used &lt;a href="http://www.greenandblacks.com/uk/what-we-make/bars/cherry.html" target="_blank">Green &amp;amp; Black&amp;rsquo;s Cherry chocolate&lt;/a>Â (still leftover from Christmas!). The mixture filled both of my ramekins right to the top, and so I filled a silicone cupcake case up with the leftovers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After cooking for around 15mins, they were nice and firm on top but lovely and gooey in the middle! They tasted really good, and it was nice with the pieces of cherries from the chocolate. I think the ones in the ramekins were a bit too much, but the cupcake size was just right!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I decided to bake cupcakes. I had some time before going to my friend Claire&amp;rsquo;s flat so I quickly put them together. I went for 3 different flavours all with vanilla sponge - plain frosting, chocolate frosting, and a swirl of nutella.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make the sponge I followedÂ &lt;a href="http://www.nigella.com/recipes/view/cupcakes-146" target="_blank">Nigella&amp;rsquo;s recipe&lt;/a>, with minor changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>125g self-raising flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>125g caster sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>125g soft unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Half a teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons milk&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Firstly, preheat the oven to 200C and line the tray with 12 cupcake cases.
&lt;p>In a bowl, cream together the sugar and butter (I melted half to make it easier). Add the vanilla extract and mix the eggs in one at a time. Then add the flour, a bit at a time, until there&amp;rsquo;s no lumps and add the milk if needed until it becomes a soft, dropping consistency. Finally spoon the mixture in to the cases so they are all roughly even.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the nutella cupcakes, at this stage I swirled in a spoonful of nutella in to the top of 4 cupcakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then place in to the oven for 15-20mins until golden. Mmm I love the smell that comes out of the kitchen during this part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the buttercream frostings, I put around 100g softened butter in a bowl and added icing sugar bit by bit until I was happy with the texture and taste. Make sure the butter is soft as it aches your arm if it&amp;rsquo;s not! I usually leave the oven door open after baking the cakes and it helps soften it up nicely. I spreaded half of the frosting on to 4 cupcakes, and the rest I mixed with cocoa powder to make 4 chocolate cupcakes. Then decorate with whatever sprinkles you have - I used gold stars and purple shimmer sugar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Delicious! I think I&amp;rsquo;ll try doing 3 different types each time I bake them so I can try out lots of new flavours.&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished making these cookies and they are soo good! I&amp;rsquo;ve only made cookies a couple of times before and usually am disappointed. So this time I searched on blogs looking for a Millie&amp;rsquo;s Cookie style cookie (yummy) and stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://laureneasmith.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/millies-cookie-recipe.html" target="_blank">this&lt;/a>. And I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These cookies are amazing, crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle - just how I like them. Jon gave them a definite thumbs up too, and so this will be my go-to recipe for cookies now. I went for simple milk choc chip cookies using a bar of dairy milk and a flake. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to experiment with different flavours in the future!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here&amp;rsquo;s how they were made, thanks to &lt;a href="http://laureneasmith.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/millies-cookie-recipe.html" target="_blank">this blog&lt;/a> which I adapted a little as I went.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/baking-cookies1.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-782" title="baking cookies1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/baking-cookies1.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1467" />&lt;/a>&lt;em>125g butter, softened//100g light brown soft sugar//125g caster sugar//1 egg//1 tsp vanilla extract//225g self-raising flour//Â½ tsp salt//1 small bar dairy milk and 1 flake&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Firstly preheat the oven to 180Â°C, gas mark 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">1. Put the brown and caster sugar in a bowl and cream together with the butter (I melted half of it to speed up the process)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">2. Combine with the egg and the vanilla extract&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">3. Add the flour and salt and mix it all together so it becomes doughy&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">4. Chop up the dairy milk and crumble the flake and mix everything together&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Finally roll the dough into a big sausage shape and cut it into 20 pieces and place on 2 trays lined with baking paper. As I didn't have large enough baking trays I could only fit 14 cookies on so with the rest I made one big cookie in a round cake tin. They go in the oven for 7mins, although they may not look cooked they should be so take them out to cool. The outside should stiffen and crisp as they cool. Or you can cook them for a bit longer if you prefer! (For me 8mins was perfect with my oven and preference)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">And enjoy! I sure did ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP3004.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" title="IMGP3004" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP3004.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="151" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I think the big cookie would be great iced as a birthday cookie, just like at Millie's cookies!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I did end up making cheescakes using the new Philadelphia with Cadbury, and they are so yum!!Â  They are so quick and easy to make, and the philadelphia alone is really nice which I found surprising as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what it would be like. You could just spread it on a digestive and you&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much got a tasty cheesecake already. But I decided to go ahead and make the cheesecakes featured on the Philadelphia website &lt;a href="http://www.philadelphia.co.uk/philadelphia3/page?locale=uken1&amp;amp;PagecRef=609&amp;amp;rid=40107&amp;amp;fb_source=message" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2545.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-380 aligncenter" title="IMGP2545" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2545-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-align: center;">75Â gÂ light digestiveÂ biscuits (I used 4.5 biscuits)&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">20Â gÂ butter, melted&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">160Â gÂ Philadelphia with Cadbury&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">180Â gÂ double cream&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">20Â gÂ icing sugar&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
Firstly to make the base just bash up the biscuits in to crumbs and mix with the melted butter. Place the mix in to 5 ring moulds (6-7cm) or ramekins or maybe just make one big cheesecake, and place in the fridge. Then in a bowl whisk together the Philadelphia with Cadbury (the tub is 160g so use it all), double cream and icing sugar. Once it's all mixed together and looking good (have a taste ;)), place it on to the cheesecake bases and spread it all over the top, then return them to the fridge for a couple of hours to set. You could add whatever you'd like to the philly mixture, like fudge pieces or chocolate chips, to make it even better!
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2565.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-387 aligncenter" title="IMGP2565" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2565-300x218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
They make just the right sized cheesecakes, perfect.Â The Philadelphia is currently on offer at Asda for Â£1 for a 160g tub. Let me know if you make any, or have tried the Cadbury Philadelphia!

I decided to follow a recipe from the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943" target="_blank">Baking Made Easy&lt;/a> by Lorraine Pascale. I thought the recipe was good, but only if you are making very large cupcakes or more than than 12! Even though the recipe states that it makes 12, the cases were overfilled and there was so much buttercream!! Got enough for 12 more cakes leftover, and cut the peaks off the cakes which were eaten very quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2484.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-298 aligncenter" title="IMGP2484" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2484-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
I tried out my &lt;a title="New Icing Bag Set" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/tala-icing-bag-set/">Tala icing bag&lt;/a> too, and it was really good! The buttercream was sooo stiff though, I'll try a different recipe next time, so the icing didn't come out so good because of this as my hand was hurting :/ But they tasted good and that's the main thing! I used coloured shimmer sugar in pink and blue to match the cases and make them look pretty.
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2512.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-299 aligncenter" title="IMGP2512" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2512-300x263.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="263" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Today is pancake day, so of course I had to make pancakes for breakfast :) Over the weekend I made the Martha Stewart pancakes which I wrote about &lt;a title="Valentineâs Baking and Craft Ideas" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/valentines-baking-and-craft-ideas/">here&lt;/a> and they were more American style and were &lt;em>really&lt;/em> good! I usually make the thin type and generally follow &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/basicpancakeswithsuga_66226">this&lt;/a> recipe, although I only use 1 egg, and I made these today as I think they're quicker to make than American style. Sadly we've run out of nutella but I still had a couple of strawberries with sugar. Although the bag of sugar does seem to have a hole in the bottom as my kitchen floor was covered in it afterwards, oops :/

I've been spending a bit of my birthday money online and am currently waiting for my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tala-Icing-Bag-Nozzles-Booklet/dp/B002U5C4ZC/ref=sr_1_2?s=kitchen&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1329864909&amp;amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">Tala Icing Bag Set in Tin&lt;/a> so I can start baking cupcakes as I've lost part of my old icing bag set, and this one looks so cute in the tin! I'm also expecting my &lt;a href="http://www.echoparkpaper.com/collections/for-the-record/" target="_blank">Echo Park For the Record&lt;/a> Paper Collection Kit to come soon, so I can continue scrapbooking, love the alphas and elements in this set. So hopefully they'll be here tomorrow!
&lt;p>I also just found out that last Thursday was apparently something called &lt;a href="http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/90408,Poles-gorge-themselves-on-Fat-Thursday" target="_blank">Fat Thursday&lt;/a>, gutted I missed out on that one. It&amp;rsquo;s a Polish tradition, an alternative to pancake day, where they basically eat a lot of doughnuts - I&amp;rsquo;ve marked it on my calender for next year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone celebrate Fat Thursday here? Seems like a good thing to celebrate :p&lt;/p>

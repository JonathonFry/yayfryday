I&amp;rsquo;ll drink it occasionally if we have some made up or if we&amp;rsquo;re in a coffee shop, but generally I&amp;rsquo;d make a green tea if I&amp;rsquo;m having a hot drink. To be honest it&amp;rsquo;s probably because of my laziness as I find green tea the easiest and quickest to make. But I do love a good coffee cake, especially the coffee flavoured buttercream icing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a craving for that coffee icing and so after I rummaged through the cupboards I decided to get baking. A quick google search landed me with Nigella&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nigella.com/recipes/coffee-and-walnut-layer-cake" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Coffee and Walnut Layer Cake&lt;/a> recipe that I used as a base. I made some amendments to Nigella&amp;rsquo;s recipe based on the ingredients I had (eg replaced butter with coconut oil) and also chose to make cupcakes, simply because I find them easier to make and to eat (plus they are faster to bake ;)).&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sponge was delicious and the icing was just what I was looking for - great flavours with a good amount of coffee. I froze half of them and took some out of the freezer to defrost a few weeks later and they were just as good, the nuts still crunchy and the sponge still moist.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coffee and Walnut Cupcakes (makes 18):&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Sponge:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>50g walnut pieces&lt;/li>
&lt;li>225g caster sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>225g coconut oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g plain flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4tsp instant espresso powder (I used Illy Classic Roast Ground Coffee)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2.5tsp baking powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>0.5tsp bicarbonate of soda&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 large eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1-2tbsp milk&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Buttercream Frosting:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>230g icing sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>115g soft unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5tsp instant espresso powder (dissolved in 2/3tbsp boiling water)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>walnut pieces to decorate&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Method:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 170°C and line a cupcake tray with 18 cupcake cases. I had to bake these in two batches as I only have one tray.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a food processor blitz together the walnut pieces and sugar to a powder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the butter, flour, espresso powder, baking powder, bicarb and eggs and process to a smooth batter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the milk and combine to loosen the cake mixture. It should be a soft dropping consistency, so add more milk if needed. (If you are making this by hand, bash the nuts to a powder with a rolling pin and mix with the dry ingredients; then cream the butter and sugar together, and beat in some dry ingredients and eggs alternately and, finally, the milk.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divide the mixture between the cupcake cases and bake in the oven for around 18 minutes, or until the sponge has risen and feels springy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool the cupcakes on a wire rack, and once cool you can make the buttercream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a food processor (or by hand using a wooden spoon), mix the icing sugar with the butter to make a smooth icing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dissolve the instant expresso powder in the boiling water and add it to the processor and blend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spread the icing on top of the cupcakes and top with the walnut pieces.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

I was given Madeleine Shaw&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Get-Glow-Delicious-Recipes-Nourish/dp/140915744X/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Get The Glow&lt;/a> book for Christmas, where she talks about ditching sugar completely and the health benefits in doing so. We saw it as a good challenge which would also be good for our health. The day we decided to do it we checked the food we had and made sure none of it contained added sugar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as difficult as I thought it would be to cut out. Green tea with lemon and Nakd bars kept any cravings away, and it felt good to not have sugar crashes. Plus both of us were doing it so we could encourage each other and make sure we didn&amp;rsquo;t slip up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After our wedding we&amp;rsquo;ve been eating sugar (lots of wedding cake and champagne started it off), though we don&amp;rsquo;t drink squash or eat cereal anymore and still snack on Nakd bars. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will completely cut out sugar again right now, I will aim to cut it out the majority of the time and save it for special occasions only (eg birthday cakes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I baked lemon cupcakes with pistachios as a weekend treat from Get The Glow. They contain honey as a sugar substitute and I chose to use coconut oil as the fat. I followed the recipe but they came out a little dark on top so I think for my oven the temperature could be lowered. The cupcakes are delicious with the zing from the lemon and the crunchy pistachios, and super easy to bake.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>170g ground almonds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1tsp bicarbonate of soda&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pinch salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>zest of 3 lemons, juice of 2 lemons&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas mark 4. Place 8 cupcake cases in muffin tray.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mix the ground almonds, bicarbonate of soda, salt and lemon zest in a bowl. Separately, mix the honey with the coconut oil, then add the eggs one at a time, then the lemon juice. Pour this on top of the ground almond mixture, and mix together. Divide the cake mixture into the cupcake cases, then sprinkle the pistachios on top.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today I baked these yummy iced lemon drizzle cupcakes as I had some lemons that needed using. I had roughly 115g of caster sugar left so I used that amount to judge how much other ingredients to use. I forgot that I&amp;rsquo;d need some more caster sugar for the drizzle but I used soft brown sugar instead and it tastes just as good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1903" alt="ldcupcake2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake2.jpg" width="490" height="323" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made 9 cupcakes from the mixture, and had a bit of icing leftover. I also threw in a handful of poppy seeds which adds a bit of texture. The sponge is lovely and moist, and the icing makes them that little bit more special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1901" alt="ldcupcake3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake3.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the sponge:
115g caster sugar
115g self-raising flour
115g butter, softened
2 eggs
zest 1 lemon
handful of poppy seeds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the drizzle:
juice 1 lemon
60g brown sugar&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the icing:
zest and juice of 1 lemon
200g icing sugar&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Preheat oven to 160C. Beat together the butter and caster sugar until creamy, then slowly stir the eggs in one at a time. Add the flour, lemon zest and poppy seeds and mix together. Place the mixture in 9 cupcake cases and bake in the oven for 30mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make the lemon drizzle by mixing together the lemon and sugar. When the cupcakes are baked, remove them from the oven and prick them with a fork. Then spoon the drizzle over each cupcake and leave to cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once cooled, make the icing by combining the lemon zest and juice with the icing sugar until smooth. Pour over the cupcakes and leave to set. Enjoy!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Last week whilst at university, there was a lady outside the student shop with a table filled with plates of cookies, flapjacks and muffins. She was giving them away for free to promote some new products they were launching in the shop. So I picked up a muffin, I had no idea what it was but it looked good. It turned out to be a lemon and poppy seed muffin and it was delicious! So I wanted to recreate that flavour, but instead of muffins I chose to make cupcakes with lemon buttercream icing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1556" alt="lemonpoppy2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy2.jpg" width="490" height="693" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed the BBC GoodFood&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/470636/lemon-and-poppyseed-cupcakes" target="_blank">lemon and poppyseed cupcakes recipe&lt;/a> to make 12 cupcakes, although I halved the icing quantity (so glad I did!) but still used the juice of one lemon. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t bother toasting the poppy seeds, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what difference that would make? The end result is yummy nevertheless! I love the texture with the poppy seeds and the zing of lemon is so good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think they would still be tasty without the icing if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something with less sugar (and butter!) or maybe instead of buttercream making a lemon drizzle topping instead.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I decided to bake cupcakes. I had some time before going to my friend Claire&amp;rsquo;s flat so I quickly put them together. I went for 3 different flavours all with vanilla sponge - plain frosting, chocolate frosting, and a swirl of nutella.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make the sponge I followed &lt;a href="http://www.nigella.com/recipes/view/cupcakes-146" target="_blank">Nigella&amp;rsquo;s recipe&lt;/a>, with minor changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>125g self-raising flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>125g caster sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>125g soft unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Half a teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons milk&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Firstly, preheat the oven to 200C and line the tray with 12 cupcake cases.
&lt;p>In a bowl, cream together the sugar and butter (I melted half to make it easier). Add the vanilla extract and mix the eggs in one at a time. Then add the flour, a bit at a time, until there&amp;rsquo;s no lumps and add the milk if needed until it becomes a soft, dropping consistency. Finally spoon the mixture in to the cases so they are all roughly even.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the nutella cupcakes, at this stage I swirled in a spoonful of nutella in to the top of 4 cupcakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then place in to the oven for 15-20mins until golden. Mmm I love the smell that comes out of the kitchen during this part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the buttercream frostings, I put around 100g softened butter in a bowl and added icing sugar bit by bit until I was happy with the texture and taste. Make sure the butter is soft as it aches your arm if it&amp;rsquo;s not! I usually leave the oven door open after baking the cakes and it helps soften it up nicely. I spreaded half of the frosting on to 4 cupcakes, and the rest I mixed with cocoa powder to make 4 chocolate cupcakes. Then decorate with whatever sprinkles you have - I used gold stars and purple shimmer sugar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Delicious! I think I&amp;rsquo;ll try doing 3 different types each time I bake them so I can try out lots of new flavours.&lt;/p>

So today I’ve been busy making cupcakes with my favourite things ever – mini eggs. I usually use a flake on them too but I didn’t buy any so they’re a bit less chocolatey than normal, but still just as tasty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2724-2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528" title="IMGP2724 (2)" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2724-2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="346" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used my &lt;a title="New Icing Bag Set" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/tala-icing-bag-set/" target="_blank">Tala icing bag&lt;/a>, and tried out a different nozzle on the one cupcake – can you spot it? :p&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[gallery link=&amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; columns=&amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Top: 1 / 2 Bottom: 3 / 4&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;/p>
1.  &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389137/" target="_blank">We Bought a Zoo&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong> I went to see this film this morning thanks to RBS, and I really enjoyed watching it. It was a sad film, as like a lot of family movies, the Mum has died and so it's up to the Dad to look after the kids alone. The daughter Rosie is so cute, and I think Matt Damon makes a great Dad in it. They basically buy a zoo, which I totally would love to do now, and well I'll leave it up to &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389137/" target="_blank">IMDb&lt;/a> to summarise. It's based on a true story too, and think it's great that the real life family still have the zoo.
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1232829/" target="_blank">21 Jump Street&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. I saw this on Tuesday, and as I expected, it was a great comedy that I&amp;rsquo;d recommend. Jonah Hill is so funny in it! It&amp;rsquo;s based on the TV show from the 80s which starred Johnny Depp, although this is comedy unlike the original. Basically 2 guys that went to school together join the police force and end up working undercover in a high school trying to tackle a drugs case. Watch the trailer and go see it!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Funny Peculiar&lt;/strong>. Me and my boyfriend went to see this in the Festival Theatre last week. We weren&amp;rsquo;t really expecting much as we didn&amp;rsquo;t really know anything about it. We were sat 5 rows from the front, so we were surprised with how good seats we were given for free! It was such a random but funny play, and was weird to see people from TV on stage (incl. Coronation Street&amp;rsquo;s Janice Battersby, Suzanne Shaw, etc). As we walked in there was a sign saying &amp;lsquo;This play contains full nudity,&amp;rsquo; and we weren&amp;rsquo;t expecting that! We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have seen it if the tickets weren&amp;rsquo;t free, as it&amp;rsquo;s not something I would normally do because tickets are so expensive usually for theatre, so glad we got to though!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Baking&lt;/strong>. I baked chocolate cupcakes with chocolate buttercream last weekend and they were yummy! I followed &lt;a href="http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/499762/libbie-s-chocolate-cupcakes" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> recipe for the cupcakes, and it was alot easier than the last ones I made. Hardly any butter in comparison, so a lot less work for my arms trying to mix it all together, and a lot less calories! I used my new Tala measuring cup which I was delighted to be given from George East Housewares last week. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to use, especially when using American recipes which I do a lot of the time, and looks lovely!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve bought some &lt;a href="http://www.philadelphia.co.uk/philadelphia3/page?siteid=philadelphia3-prd&amp;amp;locale=uken1&amp;amp;PagecRef=842&amp;amp;cid=1337&amp;amp;pid=2188" target="_blank">Cadbury Philadelphia&lt;/a> today that I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of making a cheesecake with it tomorrow. Will let you know how that goes, I love Cadbury!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone tried it yet? Or is chocolate cheese a no-go?&lt;/p>

I decided to follow a recipe from the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943" target="_blank">Baking Made Easy&lt;/a> by Lorraine Pascale. I thought the recipe was good, but only if you are making very large cupcakes or more than than 12! Even though the recipe states that it makes 12, the cases were overfilled and there was so much buttercream!! Got enough for 12 more cakes leftover, and cut the peaks off the cakes which were eaten very quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2484.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-298 aligncenter" title="IMGP2484" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2484-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
I tried out my &lt;a title="New Icing Bag Set" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/tala-icing-bag-set/">Tala icing bag&lt;/a> too, and it was really good! The buttercream was sooo stiff though, I'll try a different recipe next time, so the icing didn't come out so good because of this as my hand was hurting :/ But they tasted good and that's the main thing! I used coloured shimmer sugar in pink and blue to match the cases and make them look pretty.
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2512.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-299 aligncenter" title="IMGP2512" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2512-300x263.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="263" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
I wonder how long they'll last...! Any recommendations of good recipes for buttercream?

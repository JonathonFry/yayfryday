&lt;p>The alarm went off on Sunday and we jumped to the end of the bed to open the blinds. It was still pretty dark outside but as our eyes adjusted we could make out a white triangle - the Matterhorn!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We packed our bags and headed for the train station lockers. It was amazing to see the mountains that were surrounding the town, it felt so different to the day before. Since the weather was so nice we decided we would take the Gornergrat train up to the top of the mountain. It was so worth it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was -17C at the top but the sun definitely helped. We hiked down from &lt;strong>Rotenboden &amp;gt; Riffelberg&lt;/strong>. This was an interesting hike as it turned out we were on a snowshoe trail (the walking trail was hidden under the snow). We came across another walker who was as confused about the trail as we were and it seemed we were way off track. We were trying to find the Riffelsee lake (which we later discovered was just buried under the snow). It was a fantastic walk regardless (although I did step thigh deep in snow twice, Jon had to help me out!).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At Riffelberg we sat in the sun with a drink and a toblerone (we couldn&amp;rsquo;t help ourselves!), before taking the train back down to Zermatt and catching the train on to Visp and onwards to Basel. (We stocked up on chocolate &amp;amp; fondue before we left too)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few weeks ago Jon &amp;amp; I took a 2-night trip to Zermatt. It was our first trip to Switzerland together and it was beautiful. We flew cheap with Easyjet to Basel and travelled down to Zermatt by train using Swiss transfer tickets. We stayed in a lovely &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/869728" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>airbnb studio apartment&lt;/a> on the river with views of the Matterhorn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two days (Friday &amp;amp; Saturday) were foggy and snowy &amp;amp; visiblity was very poor. On Friday evening we explored the car free village and cooked rösti with gruyere, finished off with swiss chocolate (of course ;)).&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We layered up for a full day out hiking, and checked which trails were open. We decided on the loop &lt;strong>Zermatt &amp;gt; Z&amp;rsquo;mutt &amp;gt; Furi &amp;gt; Zum See &amp;gt; Zermatt&lt;/strong> for our first hike with a lunch stop at &lt;a class="link" href="http://chalet-altesse-restaurant-zumsee.ch/en/restaurant-zumsee-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Restaurant Zum See&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hike was a little tiring in parts (especially when the snow was blowing in our faces) but it was good to breathe in the fresh mountain air and do some exploring. A friendly ginger cat lead us from Z&amp;rsquo;mutt almost to Furi (we actually had to run away from it so it would stop walking with us&amp;hellip;). If we stopped walking it would start meowing at us to hurry up! Lunch at Zum See was amazing, I ate croute au fromage with bacon and tomatoes (sooo good) and Jon had rösti with bacon and eggs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the afternoon we hiked &lt;strong>Zermatt &amp;gt; Findeln &amp;gt; Zermatt&lt;/strong>. There were a lot of switchbacks and we had to dodge the tobogganers coming down the trail. It was a lovely walk and we made it back down just before sunset.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a much needed bath in the evening we slept very well. The forecast was telling us that Sunday would be clear, so we set an alarm in anticipation of waking up and seeing the Matterhorn for the first time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last weekend Jon &amp;amp; I went up north to Loch Tay with 2 of our friends and their black labrador pup. This was our second time staying in Loch Tay (we stayed in a beautiful cottage there for our anniversary last year), it&amp;rsquo;s a lovely location with lots to do in the area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stayed in a 2 bedroom cottage (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3825964" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this one&lt;/a>) which had views over the lake, it&amp;rsquo;s own private beach and a games room with a table tennis table. We played board games, sat by the fire, cooked in the fantastic kitchen and went walking by the lake and up in to the mountains. There was no TV and I had no phone signal, so it was a complete retreat away from screens and it felt so good.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of August Jon and I went on a trip up north to Glencoe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neither of us had visited Glencoe before. On the drive up I read a bit about the history (the massacre of Glencoe) and we planned what we were going to do. We had picked out a walk the day before (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/buachailleetivebeag.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Buachaille Etive Beag&lt;/a>) that would cover two munros.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The drive in to Glencoe was fantastic. We arrived at the tiny campsite and quickly pitched our tent. There was a crazy amount of midges, and so there was a lot of running around and flapping about. As soon as the tent was up we ran for the car and headed straight to Glencoe village for some midge repellent. I counted 21 midge bites on my face alone&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Sep/3IMG_1958-copy.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we were quite tired after the terror of the midges, we decided we&amp;rsquo;d go for a drive down the Glen Etive minor road to Loch Etive. It was a lovely drive (this road featured in Skyfall) and we stopped off along the way to enjoy the views. We ate lunch at Loch Etive and we didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter any more midges.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After arriving back at our tent after eating dinner we settled in for the night. We then realised that we had left our bag full of our clothes and toiletries back at our flat!! So we had no walking clothes with us&amp;hellip; so no munros were to be bagged the next day :( I think it must&amp;rsquo;ve been really early when we fell asleep as we were both wide awake at 6am ready to start the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Sep/3IMG_1961.JPG"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We packed up the tent and headed straight to the car park by the three sisters. We hiked up to the lost valley which was really fun and quite a scramble! We spotted an eagle circling up high too. It was a great walk and we were the only people there. We were back at the car by 10:30 and on the road to Edinburgh shortly after.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are 282 Munros in Scotland and this is our second (&lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/08/29/ben-lomond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ben Lomond&lt;/a> was our first). Ben Vorlich is 985m (3,232ft) high. We parked the car at Loch Earn and followed the trail in almost a straight line up to the top. It was a fairly steady climb, although the final climb is pretty rocky and steep. I was very slow at going down this part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was very chilly at the top, which was refreshing after how hot I had felt on the way up.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few weeks back Jon and I went mountain biking at &lt;a class="link" href="http://7stanesmountainbiking.com/Glentress---Innerleithen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>7Stanes Glentress&lt;/a>. We went to celebrate his 24th birthday (hooray!) and it was so much fun. I was pretty nervous about going since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been cycling for a couple years (not since I&amp;rsquo;d fallen off in Greece) and never been mountain biking before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Glentress has won many awards and is one of the best biking centres in the UK. It is made up of various colour coded trails for different abilities. It&amp;rsquo;s only less than an hours drive away from Edinburgh and we hired bikes from the centre when we arrived. We stuck with the green (easy) routes which were a lot of fun, and tried part of a blue route but it terrified me!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We both really enjoyed it and although I couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk the next day I would definitely go back!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments:&lt;/strong> Ran for 28 mins yay! Felt tired at around the halfway mark but kept on going and started to feel better again towards the end. It was quiet out since it&amp;rsquo;s a bank holiday which was nice as we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to keep checking behind and moving out of the way for cyclists. Only 5 more runs and we&amp;rsquo;ll have completed C25K!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>So it&amp;rsquo;s been 11 days since my last run. With going to the Lake District, Alton Towers and Cardiff over the past week we didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to fit in any running. We are going away to Poland on Wednesday and then it&amp;rsquo;ll be another week till we&amp;rsquo;re back. Anyway, I thought this run would be a struggle after the break but it actually went really well. We started off a lot slower than usual and Jon had a bad stitch for the first half of the run, but we were able to speed up in the second half and end with some energy still left over.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Holyrood Park / dry&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 3 months since Run 2. I think when we are both working full-time evening runs will work best. We decided to run around Holyrood Park, doing the popular 5K route around Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat. Never done this run before with up and downhills. We decided to just pick up from where we left and hoped we still had it in us. The uphill was hard but once we were on the flat and it started to turn downhill it was great. Although at just under 3miles my hip started to hurt pretty bad. Hope it gets better soon and just needs a little rest. We both really enjoyed the run in the evening, it was quiet and felt cooler. Hooray for finishing week 8 finally!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday Jon &amp;amp; I, along with our friends Nat &amp;amp; Mike, set off to Loch Lomond for some hill walking. We parked up at Rowardennan to tackle Ben Lomond. The &amp;lsquo;Munro&amp;rsquo; is 974 m (3196 ft) high, making it the highest mountain we&amp;rsquo;ve walked up together. We were prepared for rain as always, but instead the sun was out the whole time and I ended up coming home with sunburnt arms&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went up via the &amp;rsquo;tourist route&amp;rsquo; and ended up going back down the same way (around 12km). We were so low on water and with the sun out we wanted to get back as soon as possible. Next time, for sure, we will take the CamelBak out with us. It was a pretty tough walk in parts during the ascent, but the way back down was so much better we were all pretty much running down it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/benlomond1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1942" alt="benlomond1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/benlomond1.jpg" width="490" height="1794" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the top we could see Ben Nevis in the distance. This was a fantastic walk and great practice for us.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday, Jon &amp;amp; I headed out for the Pentland hills for some hill walking. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been hill walking in a while, and since we are planning on walking up Ben Nevis by next Summer we thought we should get back into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We parked up at Flotterstone and did the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks Short Route&lt;/a>, a nice 10km/3hrs 30mins loop. I always try and print out the planned route before we go - Bing maps have an Ordnance Survey layer which is great and of course free!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1937" alt="pentlands2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t so great - one minute the sun was shining and the next it was pouring down. It was also super windy on the hills. I was almost blown away! The views were fantastic and we shall have to come back to do the 18km route in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since the weather&amp;rsquo;s been so great lately, Jon and I decided to make the most of it and go on a little camping trip in Scotland. Our friends recommended &lt;a href="http://www.lochlomond-trossachs.org/visiting/sallochy-campsite/menu-id-335.html" target="_blank">Sallochy campsite&lt;/a> at Loch Lomond, they&amp;rsquo;ve stayed there 3 times in the last couple of weeks! It&amp;rsquo;s around 1.5hrs drive from Edinburgh and you have to book a pitch online for £5 per person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went Friday night after Jon finished work and arrived by 8pm. It was the first time using our new Vango tent which we bought last weekend off gumtree for £20. Luckily we managed to get it up OK and get the barbecue on the go within an hour :) We stayed at one of the lochside pitches which was fantastic, just a few steps from the beach which was secluded into little coves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1908" alt="lochlomond1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond1.jpg" width="490" height="733" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were out in our shorts until 11pm and it was still so bright. We got attacked by the midges and woke up to see the little pink midge bites all over us! It was pretty chilly in the night and morning. We wrapped up whilst eating our breakfast on the beach before packing up the tent (which took us way longer than pitching it&amp;hellip;) and headed up the road to Rowardennan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1909" alt="lochlomond2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond2.jpg" width="490" height="694" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went for a walk (which was supposed to be a long one but I only brought my sandals with me) along the lake. It was super quiet after just a 5 min walk from the car park. We found an empty beach and ate our lunch admiring the views and listening to the waves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along came a duck and 2 chicks. We threw them some of the crust from our sandwiches, and along came another duck with 7 teeny fluffy chicks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1910" alt="lochlomond3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond3.jpg" width="490" height="734" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will definitely be coming back to Loch Lomond! Hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a nice weekend enjoying the sunshine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I finally have my first ever pair of hiking boots, yay! No more walking up hills in my Hunter Wellies and having sore toes and heels, although they were great at keeping the mud off me. After lots of searching online I went to McArthurGlen in Livingston and tried on a few pairs of boots I&amp;rsquo;d read good things about. In the end I chose these &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/womens/viper-womens-boot-p5978.aspx" target="_blank">Viper Women&amp;rsquo;s Waterproof Hiking Boots&lt;/a> from Mountain Warehouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me they are super comfortable, the grip is great, and they are leather too which is something I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1891" alt="boots" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Sunday we went for a walk to Cramond Island, which is a tidal island, to test out my boots. Jon wore  boots which were left in our flat by a previous tenant! I don&amp;rsquo;t think his boots are waterproof though, so he has been looking for new ones and saw they actually do a &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/mens/viper-waterproof-boot-p7481.aspx?ism=0&amp;amp;cl=BROWN" target="_blank">men&amp;rsquo;s version&lt;/a> of mine!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily the tide was out so we were able to walk across the causeway. It was seriously windy and we could barely hear each other speak. It was a lovely walk with great views of Edinburgh and the Forth Road Bridge. We walked back along the wet beach, at one point I almost got stuck and luckily my boots were tied tight or they might have come off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1892" alt="cramond" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg" width="490" height="1834" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to going for bigger walks in the future and giving these a proper test.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Thursday Jon and I drove down to the Lake District. We decided to break the journey from Edinburgh to Cardiff by staying overnight at Grasmere, and on Friday continuing on to Alton Towers and arriving in Cardiff in the evening. It was a 3hr drive to Grasmere and driving through the Lake District was gorgeous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We booked the &lt;a href="http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/grasmere-butharlyp-howe" target="_blank">Youth Hostel&lt;/a> on Monday, and the only one which had private rooms still available was the one in Grasmere. Grasmere is known as the place William Wordsworth lived, and apparently he described it as &amp;ldquo;the loveliest spot that man hath ever found&amp;rdquo;. The youth hostel was in this lovely converted Victorian mansion:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/YHA-grasmere.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1775" alt="YHA grasmere" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/YHA-grasmere.jpg" width="490" height="731" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a great, cheap place to stay. We spotted 3 deer just outside the hostel and lots of rabbits running about. We went for a walk, and having done some research before heading out we decided upon the &lt;a href="http://where2walk.co.uk/lake_district/lake_discoveries/easedale-tarn-from-grasmere/" target="_blank">walk to Easedale Tarn&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1778" alt="easedale" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale.jpg" width="490" height="1439" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a nice and easy walk, although it rained the whole time. I took a few too many photos of lambs along the first quarter of the route (they were so cute!), but as my legs started to get rather wet we sped up the hill along the waterfalls. The views were fantastic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We reached Easedale Tarn, and there were just a few people about so it was nice and quiet. Wish we had waterproof trousers though! On the way back towards Grasmere the ground was very wet and muddy. There were stepping stones almost the whole way which helped a lot (luckily I had wellies on so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad), but some parts it seemed we were walking in a stream!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale-tarn.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1777" alt="easedale tarn" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale-tarn.jpg" width="490" height="1270" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time we got back to the youth hostel we were soaked through and we turned the heating up to full to start drying out our shoes and all of our clothes. Jon had a nap for an hour whilst I read a book, and before we knew it it was dinner time! Which meant we had missed having a look around the village shops. I really wanted to go to the &lt;a href="http://www.grasmeregingerbread.co.uk/" target="_blank">Grasmere Gingerbread Shop&lt;/a>, but a look from the outside had to do instead&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/grasmere-gingerbread.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1773" alt="grasmere gingerbread" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/grasmere-gingerbread.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ate at a pub in Grasmere called The Lamb Inn which was yummy, and finished it off with apple crumble and ice-cream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day we woke up early and headed down to Alton Towers. We were there from 10-5 and luckily it stayed dry the whole time. It was super quiet too, with the longest queue being 15mins. So fun!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/altontowers.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1776" alt="altontowers" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/altontowers.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would love to do some more exploring of the Lake District, hopefully with a bit less rain next time though!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We tried a new route today straight from our flat and onto the canal from there.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today we had to run a day later than we should have because Jon had exams Monday and Tuesday. I think that made this run harder, as we were both feeling it in our legs today!

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Again we&amp;rsquo;ve had to wait 3 days till this run, exams getting in the way! All finished now though so we can get back into a better routine. Think we are going to stick with running straight from our flat too, now that we are more confident. Still felt pretty tired at the end of the run. The nike+ app told us we&amp;rsquo;d completed 5k in 32'40&amp;quot;, which would&amp;rsquo;ve included some of the walking. I hope by the end of week 9 we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do 5k running in 30 mins, but even to run 5k straight shall be an accomplishment! :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I&amp;rsquo;d heard some people say that this run is a struggle. After doing the 20 min run it seems like this one will be fine, but that confidence can mean running faster and lead to getting tired quicker. So I made sure to keep it steady and start off slowly, and it went really well. This run was the farthest and quickest of them all that we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded on the nike+ app, getting closer to that 5k!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>It rained today so no nike+. It started off really well, but between 12.5 and 20 mins was the hardest. We kept at a steady pace throughout and pushed through it. Felt good afterwards, and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome to think that 6 weeks ago we were running a minute at a time. Only 3 weeks to go, and no more walking between runs from here on!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Week 5 already, it&amp;rsquo;s going by so quick. The sun was out today and there were quite a few people along the canal. We passed a lady taking close up photos of something on the ground, and later realised it was probably of newts as we noticed them along the path and made sure not to step on any! I felt quite tired after this run, but I can feel my cardio has improved from week 1 for sure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>The wind has been so bad these last couple days and it continued today. It made it difficult for our run out but helped with the run back. It was 2 runs of 8 mins each which felt good as after 1 run there was only one more to go! At the end of the run we both felt we had energy to keep going. I love how these runs are breaking up revision, always looking forward to the next one. I&amp;rsquo;m nervous for the next one though as there won&amp;rsquo;t be any walking in between, Jon thinks it&amp;rsquo;ll be fine though so we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Wednesday / Union Canal / rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We did it!! It rained heavily all the way through the run. I had my rainproof coat on with hood up which kept most of the rain off me. Jon&amp;rsquo;s coat isn&amp;rsquo;t waterproof so he had it worse, but regardless of the rain we did the full 20 mins! It actually felt really good. I was worried I would struggle but once we started and got into a rhythm, I felt like I could keep on going. Jon didn&amp;rsquo;t take his phone with the nike+ app on because of the rain (both of our pockets were soaked through after) so we don&amp;rsquo;t know how we did for pace etc, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how next week goes!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Out early this morning as we had to park at a pay &amp;amp; display spot last night as there were no spaces left so the car needed moving. Along the canal there were lots of kids and parents doing the school run and commuters cycling so we had to run in single file most of the time. Both of our legs were still aching after we &lt;a title="Walking in the Pentlands" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/04/08/walking-in-the-pentlands/">walked in the Pentlands&lt;/a> on Saturday, so we struggled a bit to keep them moving.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / clouds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Nice and quiet along the canal today. Found this run quite hard, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because for the Thursday runs we always have 2 days of rest before it. I had a stitch on the final run and found it really hard to keep running but I was determined not to stop and made it. I&amp;rsquo;m quite nervous for next week as it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;rsquo;transitional&amp;rsquo; week which transitions from running mixed with walking to just running. Should be able to run 20 mins non-stop by the end of the week. Will see how that goes!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Saturday Jon and I went for a walk in the Pentland hills with our friends Natalie and Mike. The sun came out and it was almost 10°C so we had to make the most of it! We parked near the ski centre and walked up the steep hill, following the Capital View trail. It was really slippery with ice and mud in places and so we slipped a lot on the way down (Natalie in particular) and once you started sliding it was hard to stop!! We are all planning to invest in walking boots in the future :D&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Oh and my legs are still aching&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d make the run today but managed it (just about)!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today we went for a drive to Holyrood Park for our run and left a little later than usual. I had cereal when I woke up and it was around an hour later we went for the run. So I had a bad stitch during the first run, and when it came to the 3 min run I was really struggling but kept going. Jon thought I was going to cry..! So we paused the podcast after the run for a minute whilst I tried to get rid of it, and when it calmed down we carried on. We decided to try a different route and ended up running up a very steep muddy hill, but by the time we were up my stitch was gone and I had a sudden rush of energy. We were both very tired after and I think from now on I won&amp;rsquo;t eat breakfast until we get back home, and we won&amp;rsquo;t be doing that route again until we are fitter!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I didn&amp;rsquo;t eat breakfast before we went out today but took a banana with me for after the run (we are usually up at 8 and out around 8.45ish). We both felt a lot better this time and felt we could keep going on for longer. We noticed that this week takes less time than the previous weeks, and we cover 3.5km compared to 4.1km previously. Excited for the next run!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today felt warmer as the sun kept peeking out. Sticking with the not eating until we get home which is working out well. We ran alongside a kayak and a canal boat which was cool. Again we felt like we could run more, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we feel about that next week with the longer runs..!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>It was very cold today (as usual)! Ran along the canal again, this time there were a couple rowing boats out which was quite funny as during the walking parts they would overtake us and then the running parts we would overtake them. Jon used his headphones too whilst using the nike+ app which was cool because it let us know whenever we&amp;rsquo;d run a mile. Felt good during/after the run and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We both felt tired today, but we motivated each other to keep on going and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we did. Uni is stressful at the moment (Dissertation due on Thurs!) but we are both finding that running is helping de-stress us and gets us away from a computer and in to the fresh air which can only be a good thing :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I was worried it would be slippy out today but luckily the path along the canal had been cleared. Today was probably the least windy it&amp;rsquo;s been since we began and that definitely helped with the running, the sun even came out at one point! Ran a bit further along the canal until we were on an aqueduct that runs over the Water of Leith. We did a sprint finish on the last run, which tired us both out after!

&lt;p>Jon and I have begun to run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been into running, whenever I went for a run I&amp;rsquo;d come home and feel so tired that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to go again! I think that made me not enjoy it - pushing myself too hard and feeling defeated. I think the last time I went out for a run was 2 years ago. Then, last week Jon and I were talking about fitness and how we want to get fitter but we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough money to go to a leisure centre blah blah. We enjoy hill walking but that&amp;rsquo;s more of a weekend thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We talked about running and looked at the &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/LiveWell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k.aspx" target="_blank">Couch to 5k plan&lt;/a> that we&amp;rsquo;d heard good things about before but never properly looked into it. The 9-week plan slowly eases you into running, where you begin by mixing running and walking together and slowly build up to running a 5k. And then we decided to do it. 2 days later I bought some budget running shoes and the next day we went for our first run.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then alternate 60 seconds of running and 90 seconds of walking, for a total of 20 minutes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Actually ran week 2 run 1. I accidentally put the wrong podcast on my iPod.. oops. But got through it and felt good afterwards, without feeling like my body was melting :) My left heel rubbed a bit in my new shoes, think it&amp;rsquo;s just from wearing them in though. We are both looking forward to our next run!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. the next 2 days both of our legs ached haha we need to keep it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Tuesday / Holyrood Park / snow &amp;amp; wind
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Back on to Week 1 as I&amp;rsquo;ve sorted my iPod out now! The weather was really bad, strong winds and snow made this feel like such a workout. My hands were numb and it felt like I was running backwards when the wind was against me as I was running up a slight incline. Apparently there was a weather warning, but it made it a challenge and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did it! After coming home and having a warm shower it was worth it :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / sunshine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Yay the sun came out, although it&amp;rsquo;s still cold around 1°C it felt so much warmer. We tried a different route closer to our flat, it was more sheltered and we both really enjoyed it. Also saw signs that spring is almost here - can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it to get warmer. I felt this run was a lot easier than the last 2, that&amp;rsquo;s probably mainly due to the weather but hopefully I am getting fitter too! Both excited to start week 2 over the weekend!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Do you run? Have you ever tried the C25K plan or similar? &lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no snow in Edinburgh but it sure is cold here. Next week is looking to be colder, I really want to invest in an electric blanket! Hope you have a lovely weekend :)&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s now a month till exams and it&amp;rsquo;s starting to really sink in that by April uni will be over, forever. So I&amp;rsquo;m making sure I make the most of it and come out with a good degree, which means most of my time is taken up with studying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I try to keep one weekend day mostly free of work, and today is one of those days :) This morning Jon and I went to the cinema to see a screening of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/" target="_blank">Argo&lt;/a> which was really good (and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it), followed by some food shopping and some online catch-up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a few things I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/cows.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351" title="cows" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/cows.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="656" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went for a walk in the Pentlands with some friends when the sun came out. It was so muddy and we went the steepest possible way up the hill. The way down was particularly funny when everyone slipped in the mud except for me ha! But we do really need to invest in some walking boots :p We also stumbled across this gathering of highland cattle which completely blocked our path, so we patiently waited for them to move as we were too scared to get close!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/rolocookies.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1352" title="rolocookies" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/rolocookies.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I baked &lt;a title="Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/" target="_blank">cookies&lt;/a>, rolo ones, that lasted 2 days at most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/halloween.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1353" title="halloween" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/halloween.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to a Halloween party as a skeleton! The pic on the left was taken a couple of days before the party when I did a trial run of the make-up so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit rough. Was a great party and I only spent £2 on my &amp;lsquo;costume&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/sparklers.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1354" title="sparklers" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/sparklers.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="150" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally today I picked up some &lt;a href="http://www.tesco.com/free-sparklers/free-sparklers.pdf" target="_blank">free sparklers&lt;/a> from Tesco (click the link to get the coupon), a few of us plan on going up Blackford Hill to watch some fireworks tomorrow night, can&amp;rsquo;t wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, I&amp;rsquo;m going to put on the kettle for a hot chocolate and try to apply for some jobs. Have a nice Sunday!&lt;/p>

Sorry it&amp;rsquo;s been a while, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing much worth sharing since I&amp;rsquo;ve been back in uni and settling in. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched my degree course from Maths with Finance to just Maths which I am so much happier with, and am now back in the swing of things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s some pics Jon took on his phone - the Samsung Galaxy S2 - of things we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently (minus the cookie pics which came from my camera). I think some of them came out pretty well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/dianai.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1253" title="diana&amp;amp;i" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/dianai.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="735" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Taking photos with my Diana F+&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/bigcookie.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1256" title="bigcookie" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/bigcookie.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Baking lots of chewy cookies (recipe &lt;a title="Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/George-Heriot-School.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1257" title="Camera 360" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/George-Heriot-School.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="799" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Visiting &lt;a href="http://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/george-heriots-trust-historic-building-p245351" target="_blank">George Heriot's School&lt;/a> as part of Edinburgh's &lt;a title="European Heritage Days" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/european-heritage-days/" target="_blank">Open Door Days&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/corstophinehill1.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260" title="corstophinehill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/corstophinehill1.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Walking around the wooded Corstophine Hill and up the &lt;a href="http://www.corstorphinehill.org.uk/thetower.htm" target="_blank">tower&lt;/a> (which was open as another part of the Open Door Days).&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">When we turned around from that viewpoint above this is what we saw...&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/zebra.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261" title="zebra" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/zebra.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="629" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">..Zebras! Through a large fence is Edinburgh Zoo, which backs on to a path around the hill. We could hear kids shouting from inside the zoo and that's when we noticed that the zebras were right up by the fence near us! Gotta love seeing a herd of zebras whilst walking through the woods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Hope you're having a lovely weekend!&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s our first &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; walk in the Hills and we both really enjoyed it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1214&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;490&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1214" title="allermuir hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326" />&lt;/a> Allermuir Hill (493m)[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got the ski lift going part of the way up which saved our legs a bit of work. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to ride on it before and seeing as &lt;a title="European Heritage Days" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/european-heritage-days/" target="_blank">it was free&lt;/a> it had to be done. Great views at the top of the slopes too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/cvw.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1215" title="capital view walk" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/cvw.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1752" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How cute are those thatched cottages?! The walk passes through the lovely Swanston village, where apparently Robert Louis Stevenson spent his summer days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took us a little over 2 hours to complete the loop, and our legs were aching by the end of it. There were a few steep parts that got our heart pumping. We need to do this more often and would love to do the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks&lt;/a> walk in the future!&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Walked&lt;/em> in the Pentland Hills in the rain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Shopped&lt;/em> in TK Maxx. Jon picked up an outdoorsy coat and I found some glass cups (we only had one left) which we managed to get the price down to 50p per cup!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Watched&lt;/em> 2 free movies at the cinema. Hope Springs and Untouchable - I recommend both, &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/" target="_blank">Untouchable&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Explored&lt;/em> a part of Edinburgh we hadn't been to before. More on that below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Enjoyed&lt;/em> our last week before University begins.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div>[hr]&lt;/div>
The part of Edinburgh we went to was a bit of a spur of the moment thingy. After driving back from TK Maxx, I spotted a sign for the &lt;a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/vc/index.html" target="_blank">Royal Observatory&lt;/a> and thought we should check it out. We drove past the lovely shops in Morningside and through Blackford, past some gorgeous (and huge) houses that we dreamed of living in, and finally up the steep hill to the Observatory.
&lt;p>We parked up and it seemed like we weren&amp;rsquo;t in the city anymore. We were on &lt;a href="http://www.fohb.org/new/index.htm" target="_blank">Blackford Hill&lt;/a> which is a local nature reserve  with fields of grass, crags, a lake and river. So we decided to walk up to the top of hill.  It was such a windy day and at the top I struggled to stand straight! The views from the top were the best I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Edinburgh (a 360° panorama). It was also really quiet, just a few dog walkers and that was it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These photos were taken on my phone so they&amp;rsquo;re pretty bad quality. [Jon&amp;rsquo;s just renewed his phone contract and now has a Samsung Galaxy S2 (woo!) so I can use the camera on that when I don&amp;rsquo;t have my proper camera with me now :D]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1195" title="blackford hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1063" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love finding new places like this. This would be an awesome place to come and watch fireworks or for a picnic in the sun. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised it&amp;rsquo;s not so well known!&lt;/p>

The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good but we wanted to get some fresh air and exercise after a very lazy weekend (think movies and lots of ice-cream). From our flat to the park it&amp;rsquo;s about 2.5miles through Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s old town. We had planned on walking up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat but the ground was quite slippery so skipped it this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988" title="holyrood" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1062" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead we walked along the Salisbury Crags and up to the base of Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat and around in a loop. There were quite a lot of people about, and a few runners covered in mud. We would like to live near here so we could go jogging around the park in the mornings, perhaps one day we will try and jog there and back from our flat (hmm just maybe).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh, it&amp;rsquo;s nice having such a big park so close to the city centre and with great views of the city. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of walks to do in the park, and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it to anyone visiting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989" title="holyrood2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="343" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully the weather will pick up soon, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe we are already in July.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rainy Days</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/rainy-days/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2012 15:24:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/rainy-days/</guid><description>&lt;p>The weather hasn&amp;rsquo;t been too great recently. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel like yesterday was the beginning of summer. I&amp;rsquo;m not enjoying spending so much time in the flat, especially as I made some calculations and figured we couldn&amp;rsquo;t spend any money until the end of July (next payday) for us to afford rent over summer. So we shall have to start making money other ways and doing as much free stuff to keep us entertained!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we went to Union Canal in Fountainbridge with some leftover crusts of bread. We were soaked by the time we returned home but it feels good once in a while to get out in the rain and not care about being wet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887" title="feedducks" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="531" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny moment when Jon threw some bread, we heard a thump and a pigeon fly right across us, he accidentally hit the poor thing! We felt like kids feeding the ducks, and think we shall go and feed them each time we have old stale bread instead of throwing it in the bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been doing with all these rainy days?&lt;/p>

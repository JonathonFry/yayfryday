&lt;p>They survived!! After 2 weeks away in Cardiff I came back to my flat to find my herbs hadn&amp;rsquo;t died. In fact, the soil from the chives and basil was still nice and moist. As you can see from the pics they aren&amp;rsquo;t looking too great though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The parsley in particular has gone quite wild. I wish I thinned that out earlier on since it&amp;rsquo;s all knotted together now. Not really sure what to do with the chives either. The basil on the other hand is looking fine, I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to thin it down to just one plant (moving the far right big one in to the middle of the pot) but then I might end up with nothing left&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As you can see they&amp;rsquo;re all still alive and growing :) I thinned the basil and parsley down quite a lot, I felt bad doing it but they were so overcrowded (the parsley&amp;rsquo;s still a bit wild). The parsley was pretty difficult as it&amp;rsquo;s become quite tangled but I managed to thin out about half of the seedlings. And now they are all starting to grow their second set of &amp;rsquo;true leaves'.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m off down to Cardiff tomorrow morning for the next two weeks, yay! I hope the herbs don&amp;rsquo;t all die by the time I get back though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Woah they&amp;rsquo;re growing quick! Especially the parsley, since &lt;a title="Seedlings" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/seedlings/">last week&lt;/a> there were only 3 measly seedlings there. The basil is starting to grow it&amp;rsquo;s first &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; leaves, which means I&amp;rsquo;ll have to thin them out soon - I&amp;rsquo;m scared it&amp;rsquo;ll result in them all dying though. Not really sure what to do with the chives either, any ideas? Tempted to just leave them grow but I don&amp;rsquo;t want them to kill each other?! Hmm we&amp;rsquo;ll see how they do for now!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yay! Some little seedlings have appeared a week after planting my &lt;a title="Grow Your Own Herbs" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/grow-your-own-herbs/">Gardener&amp;rsquo;s World Seeds&lt;/a>. The basil came up first and can already see I&amp;rsquo;ll have to do quite a bit of thinning with those. Only 3 of my parsley seeds have sprouted, but that&amp;rsquo;s better than none! The chives were the slowest to sprout, but now there are quite a few seedlings and they&amp;rsquo;re growing up fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll all keep on growing now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

So today my BBC Gardeners&amp;rsquo; World Herb Kit arrived. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to grow herbs on our windowsill for a while now, and getting the free voucher meant I could purchase some!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/herbkit.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1085" title="herbkit" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/herbkit.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="205" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kit comes with Chive, Parsley and Basil seeds, compost, tray and these cool pots that you can write on with chalk. I sowed the seeds today and hopefully they will grow so we can use them. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Will post up on their progress after a week or so!&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go back to Switzerland since our Zermatt trip in January 2015 (I wrote about that trip &lt;a class="link" href="https://yayfryday.com/zermatt-switzerland-in-the-fog-snow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://yayfryday.com/zermatt-switzerland-in-the-sun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>), and when cheap flights to Milan came up we thought we&amp;rsquo;d combine seeing Milan with a short trip in to Switzerland. It was a busy weekend, though we were forced to slow down with a 2 hour train delay which ended up being one of my highlights of the trip!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trip began with a late evening flight to Milan Malpensa, where we stayed the night in an airport hotel. The next morning we were up early for our first train journey to get us in to Milan, where we would then travel from Milan to Tirano then another train from Tirano to Pontresina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We bought the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.regione.lombardia.it/wps/portal/istituzionale/HP/DettaglioServizio/servizi-e-informazioni/Cittadini/Muoversi-in-Lombardia/biglietti-e-agevolazioni/Io-viaggio/io-viaggio-ovunque-in-lombardia-biglietti-giornaliero-settimanale/io-viaggio-ovunque-in-lombardia-biglietti-giornaliero-settimanale" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;lsquo;io viaggio ovunque in Lombardia - biglietti&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a> ticket (aka travel anywhere in Lombardy ticket) which covered us for all of our travel, minus the Switzerland leg. At €32.50 for a three day pass it&amp;rsquo;s really good value. We bought it at the train station at the start of our journey (Somma Lombardo). We rode the Milan to Tirano train alongside Lake Como, arriving at lunchtime in Tirano for a quick bite of pizza. Next we were on the Swiss train on the picturesque Bernina line (we rode the regular train rather than Bernina Express so we could get on/off freely). We jumped off at Morteratsch Glacier and walked the well marked trail, which was lined with information points. We continued on the train to Pontresina, checked in to our hotel (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.chesa-mulin.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hotel Garni Chesa Mulin&lt;/a>) before nipping out for dinner. We had raclette in a lovely wooden chalet next to a roaring fire - we were stuffed with cheese and ready for plenty of dreams.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We stocked up on Swiss chocolate in the morning before our journey back to Milan, via St Moritz and Chiavenna. Starting with a train from Pontresina to St Moritz. The lake in St Moritz was frozen over and after a wander around the town we went for a walk over it, the scenery was gorgeous. We then bought our bus tickets and caught the bus that took us all the way out of Switzerland to Chiavenna in Italy. The bus ride was amazing, winding down mountain road switchbacks and squeezing through tiny village streets.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>When we arrived in Chiavenna we had a bit of time before our next train to Milan, so we went for lunch near the station. But when we went to catch the train it didn&amp;rsquo;t show up, and after frantically running around it turned out our train had been cancelled and the next one was due in two hours (I&amp;rsquo;m sure if we were still in Switzerland this would never happen!). This meant we&amp;rsquo;d lose a couple hours in Milan in the evening, but since it was a lovely day we were sure to make the most of it and headed straight for gelato. We explored Chiavenna, which we soon started to fall for and think it would make a great day trip from Milan. We walked to Parco Paradiso which was beautiful and had great views at the top.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After two hours exploring we were on the train to Milan (via Colico). It was a very busy train with people standing in the aisles, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most enjoyable. We arrived in Milan in the evening, checked in to our &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/15715097" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>AirBnB on Naviglio Darsena&lt;/a>, and popped out for dinner at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.risoelatte.com/eng/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Risoelatte&lt;/a>. It was an interesting restaurant with 60s decor, the food was great and we went with the classic risotto alla milanese finished up with tiramisu.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Our final day was spent exploring Milan. We started the day off by dumping our bags at a bag drop in &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.californiabakery.it/locations/#!san-vittore" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>California Bakery&lt;/a>, and then walked the city taking in as many sights (and as much food) as we could. We visited the duomo di milano, San Bernardino alle Ossa, Sforzesco Castle &amp;amp; Sempione Park, and Basilica di Sant&amp;rsquo;Ambrogio. Fuelled by gelato, obviously.&lt;/p>

At just under four hours drive from Edinburgh, the Silver Sands of Morar on Scotland&amp;rsquo;s east coast can be reached.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We camped for two nights at &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sunnysidetouringsite.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Sunnyside Croft&lt;/a> which has direct access to a lovely beach with gorgeous sunset views. We walked a long stretch of the coast, ending just past Camusdarach Beach. There were lots of small sandy coves and most beaches we had to ourselves. We had dinner in a pub in Arisaig and ate ice creams whenever we had the chance. It somehow reached 26C whilst we were there in May. It did not feel like we we were still in Scotland!&lt;/p>

Relaxing in front of a cosy fire, trips to a local pub and frosty walks were just what I was looking for and I knew a return to Loch Tay would be a perfect place for that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon &amp;amp; I booked a stay at a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1866736" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>converted mill&lt;/a>, a gorgeous airbnb that the listing didn&amp;rsquo;t do justice. We felt very lucky to stay in such a wonderful place with views overlooking the loch.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We arrived at Loch Tay about an hour before sun set, after a lovely drive from Edinburgh through the Trossachs. Since it was such a nice day we decided to detour last minute up the road toward Ben Lawers. We parked the car before the road got too icy and made it on foot to reach the Ben Lawers Dam. It was very cold and windy, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t take too long before we were on our way back to warm up in the car. The sun was setting and the sky was turning pink. Plenty of sheep on the road made us take a slow journey down the mountain and it gave us plenty of time to take in the sunset.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By the time we reached the bottom it had turned dark and the search for the mill where we were spending the night began. After plenty of back and forths we found the house and after exploring all the rooms and being surprised at how much bigger it was than the photos, we lit the fire and pulled the blankets out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The sun was out again on Saturday which meant after breakfast I soon had itchy feet and wanted to go out to explore. We drove out along the loch and round to the crannog centre for some great views. The short walk up to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/perthshire/falls-of-acharn.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Falls of Acharn&lt;/a> was lovely and the waterfalls were flowing fast. For lunch we stopped off at the Habitat Cafe in Aberfeldy for some delicious soup and hot drinks, just what I needed after a cold walk. We carried on back towards the mill, making a stop at Castle Menzies and another short walk through &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/perthshire/weem-wood.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Weem Wood to St David’s Well&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By the time we were back in the car the Wales v England rugby had started, so we hurried back to drop the car off and then walked along the road to the pub at the Ben Lawers Hotel. They were playing the rugby in a small room which looked like it was someone’s living room with three big sofas. We were later joined by a family from Newcastle, but thankfully a couple of them were also Welsh supporters! After some drinks and a defeat, we walked back to the mill for another night sat in front of the fire.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My birthday began with strawberry pancakes and Jon walking in with a birthday cake lit with matchsticks (after forgetting the candles!). We spent some time on the balcony watching the clouds lift and the sun peak out over the mountains. Soon we were back on the road in the direction of Edinburgh, but we were lucky again with the weather so had to make a stop to squeeze in another walk before we went back. We walked the Kiltyrie Hidden History Trail which was a great loop, but it was quite open and the wind was very cold so we had to keep moving. We made sure to climb on to a boulder for some jump photos though. Back in the car for the rest of the journey home after another lovely trip to Loch Tay!&lt;/p>

But that&amp;rsquo;s where we ended up going, and it turns out there&amp;rsquo;s much more to this Balearic Island than partying - with beautiful sunsets, turquoise bays, and an old town with narrow streets that you can get lost in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stayed in a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sunsetvillaibiza.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>6 bedroom villa&lt;/a> in Cala Salada. The villa was only a 15 minute walk to Cala Saladeta, a stunning beach that we had to ourselves if we were up early enough! We also hired a car which made getting about super easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are my highlights from our family trip to Ibiza.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Early morning walks to Cala Saladeta, having the beach to ourselves and watching the sun rise up over the hills. Beach hopping to Cala Comte and Cala d&amp;rsquo;Hort. A bit of off road driving and a walk to the Es Vedrà viewpoint. Those views. Watching a thunderstorm over the Mediterranean Sea. Swimming in the pool every day.&lt;/p>

Jon &amp;amp; I agreed that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave Scotland before we visited, and so we finally made it there this year. We drove up on Jon&amp;rsquo;s birthday (May 24th), which we hoped would be the best time of year in terms of weather and midges. Turned out we were extremely lucky with both - sunshine, 20 something degrees and zero midge bites. Definitely not typical of a Scottish holiday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We spent three glorious days exploring Skye. Here are my highlights of the trip.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reflections of Eilean Donan Castle on the way to Skye. Walks with stunning and diverse scenery including the Fairy Pools, Coral Beach, Old Man of Storr, and the Quiraing. Checking off a munro by hiking up Bruach na Frithe. The moment the clouds finally cleared for the final stretch and I had that on top of the world feeling.&lt;/p>

Having a nap in the car during a rain shower then waking up and seeing the Isle of Skye Brewery opposite. Dinner at Edinbane Inn. The ferry back from Armadale to Mallaig and an epic drive home.&lt;/p>

On Friday I heard that the cherry blossom had arrived in the Meadows so I made plans to take a walk to the park on Saturday with camera in hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We walked to the Meadows via Bruntsfield, with a scrummy stop off at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cafegrande.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cafe Grande&lt;/a> for a late breakfast. I had a bacon breakfast roll and Jon went for poached eggs on toast, gobbled down with a cup of tea and a cappuccino.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I recommend a trip to the Meadows for plenty of cherry blossom photo opportunities. Just get there early if it&amp;rsquo;s a sunny day - before the barbecuers descend (or you could join them).&lt;/p>

>five day trip to Barcelona&lt;/a> we stayed four nights in two wonderful hotels. Since it was a special trip for us (our first wedding anniversary), we wanted to stay somewhere memorable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Staying in two hotels was partly due to the fact that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t availability in one of the hotels the whole time we were in Barcelona, so we thought we&amp;rsquo;d make the most of it and discover two areas of the city. We&amp;rsquo;ve also done this before to see the &amp;rsquo;tourist&amp;rsquo; areas but also see the more local side of a city.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Three nights were spent in the delicious &lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.hotelpraktikbakery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hotel Praktik Bakery&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. The hotel is a bakery hotel (a hotel and bakery combined), that had me hooked as soon as I stumbled on it on TripAdvisor. It was an obvious choice to stay here, a unique concept and the bedrooms were beautiful and simple. The location (L&amp;rsquo;Eixample) was ideal for us to visit the Gaudi sights as well as all the other spots in the centre of the city.&lt;/p>

I was attracted to this hotel because it was highly rated, has cool interior design and looked like a nice local area (El Poble-sec). There are lots of walks and parks in the area, as well as tasty restaurants and bars. It&amp;rsquo;s right near the port cable car and the Montjuïc castle is up the hill.&lt;/p>

The sunshine won in the end and we spent five wonderful days in sunny Barcelona.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In High School I did a project in Art class where I chose to focus on architecture. That&amp;rsquo;s where I remember discovering Antoni Gaudí, and his wonderfully distinctive style. I saw pictures of the colouful Park Guell and many of the buildings scattered around Barcelona, and I was inspired. Fast forward twelve years later and there I am - stood beneath the Sagrada Familia in awe.&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why we had never though of visiting Mallorca before, but I am so glad we did. We stayed with my family at the dreamy &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/4542621?sug=51" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are my highlights of our trip (besides relaxing by the pool and barbecues at the villa) in chronological order, with a bunch of photos too:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Port de Pollença&lt;/strong> - A lovely drive along the coast from Alcudia beach alongside cyclists, windsurfers and kitesurfers.&lt;/p>

loading="lazy"
alt="Port de Pollença Cyclist"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mirador Es Colomer&lt;/strong> - Spectacular views of the coast and the Tramuntana mountains, with dramatic cliffs and the ocean that stretches out as far as the eye can see. There is a car park which can get very busy but quick turnaround of cars means you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to wait long for a space. There is a small cafe too.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Playa de Formentor&lt;/strong> - A gorgeous narrow beach with mountain views and a backdrop of pine trees. Clear waters and a great spot for a dip in the sea to break up the drive on the way to Cap Formentor. We visited in the evening and it was pretty quiet. There are sun loungers you can hire or free gaps to set yourself up on the beach.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cap Formentor&lt;/strong> - Watching the sunset here at the northernmost tip of Mallorca is incredible. There is parking at the lighthouse but people ended up just parking in the road as it filled up. The drive is quite thrilling too and part of the experience - watch out for goats!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cuevas del Drach&lt;/strong> - There are lots of caves in Mallorca and we visited the well known &amp;ldquo;Dragon Caves&amp;rdquo; on the East of the island. The caves are extensive and the walk ends at a large underground lake with a small classical concert. Just be sure to hold back when entering to avoid the crowds (it gets super busy).&lt;/p>

loading="lazy"
alt="Cuevas del Drach"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>S&amp;rsquo;Amarador&lt;/strong> - This gorgeous unspoilt white sand beach is tucked away in the wild Mondrago Natural Park. There are lots of walks you can take from here and there is a beach shack selling food and amazing fresh cocktails (the mojito was excellent). There is paid parking and you should avoid using google maps to get here (you reach a road sign that says &amp;lsquo;GPS IS WRONG&amp;rsquo; and need to turn back) - instead follow the clear brown signs for S&amp;rsquo;Amarador.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cala d&amp;rsquo;Or&lt;/strong> - This resort is near to Mondrago park and we stopped at the marina here for dinner. There are plenty of restaurants and bars to chose from, and a nice place to wander around the big yachts. We ate at Aquarius looking out on to the marina. The food was good and prices decent, but the service wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Valldemossa&lt;/strong> - A wonderfully picturesque village in the mountains. We wandered amongst the cobbled streets filled with plants and bunting, taking lots of photographs as every street was so photo-worthy. This was a definite highlight of the trip for me. Lots of great places for lunch and ice-cream here too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Deià&lt;/strong> - This village is just a 10 minute drive away from Valldemossa. There are fantastic mountain backdrops as you look across to the village, with more cobbled streets and pretty bunting in the centre.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our final day in Copenhagen began with more Danish pastries. We walked round the corner from our AirBnB and down a small alley to a Laura&amp;rsquo;s Bakery - yum! We sat outside enjoying our last Danish breakfast, chatting about what we could do today (our feet were still tired from yesterday so we didn&amp;rsquo;t want too much walking).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We decided on a visit to Nørrebro since we were recommended it as a different atmosphere to where we were staying, particularly Ravensborggade compared to Værnedamsvej. We hopped on a bus there (saving our feet). We wandered around the area - it has a more multi-cultural feel compared to Vesterbro, with a variety of shops. I think the area is also known for its nightlife.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13243735_10154257170189216_2588355455464754961_o.jpg"

loading="lazy"
alt="Norrebro"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We walked along Ravensborggade which was filled with antique shops with shopkeepers sitting out in the street in the sun. It was around midday and as we passed some nice cafes I thought we could get away with an early lunch. We ate Smørrebrød (open sandwiches) outside at &lt;a class="link" href="http://gavlen.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cafe Gavlen&lt;/a>. Very tasty and filling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13308222_10154080808841399_8139281782870459394_o.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Smorrebrod"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back on a bus to our AirBnB we packed up our stuff and dropped our bags into a locker in Copenhagen central station. With no plans we walked towards the shops, passing by City Hall (Københavns Rådhus) where there were a load of plant pots placed on the floor. We rested our feet at a Joe &amp;amp; The Juice (they are everywhere here!) and eyed up an Italian restaurant opposite that we thought would be great for dinner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13243907_10154080936331399_2991638085502378453_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We fancied a hotdog at a hotdog stand but thought we&amp;rsquo;d need cash so I tried to withdraw some but kept getting declined and thought my card might&amp;rsquo;ve been blocked. (I use the Halifax Clarity card when travelling and try to avoid cash.) Thinking we&amp;rsquo;d be without money the rest of the day, we walked to Rosenborg castle which was close by. The renaissance architecture was gorgeous and was set in lovely grounds. We didn&amp;rsquo;t go inside just wandered around outside and found a spot for a short nap. As I woke up there were two swans walking straight towards us. Thinking they were about to attack we jumped up, they had no fear of us and sat right where we were sitting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13301290_10154080809701399_3583480322472227623_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After an hour we crossed over to the Botanical Gardens for more relaxing in lovely surroundings. There were red squirrels running up and down trees together. One stopped right by my feet as Jon was snapping photos of them. By the glasshouses there was an ice-cream van and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try my card and hope for the best. Thankfully it worked and so we both went for chocolate and nougat ice creams - delicious - though the cost was crazy at £4 each!!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were told the gardens would be closing soon so we made our way out and back toward the Italian restaurant we found earlier. We passed the organic hotdog stand (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.xn--dp-lka.dk/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>DØP&lt;/a> - we heard about it before our trip) and noticed they accepted card so we felt we had to get one after our disappointment earlier. We shared a regular hotdog and it was so good! Something we noticed about Copenhagen is everywhere we went accepted card - all of the street food stalls/markets we visited did and they also offered some kind of phone payment too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13246267_10154080809946399_2521536337749584355_o.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Hotdog at DØP Copenhagen"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I called our shared hotdog a &amp;lsquo;starter&amp;rsquo; so I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel bad about going straight to the Italian restaurant. The restaurant was called &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.italiano.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ristorante Italiano&lt;/a>, and has been there since 1952 (apparently the first Italian in Copenhagen). We sat outside where there were blankets and heaters, though it was still sunny and warm when we were there. We both ate pizza and Jon had his last Danish beer of the trip.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13247677_10154257171514216_4177888260126791177_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feeling like we&amp;rsquo;d eaten all we could during our time here, we walked for our last time through this wonderful city to central station for our train to the airport. We had a fantastic 72 hours in Copenhagen, Jon said it was his favourite city break so far and it was up there for me too. The public transport was easy and the people were lovely and friendly. The prices weren&amp;rsquo;t as high as we thought they could be (depends where you go like any city), though we noticed desserts were ridiculous - in restaurants they were the same price as the mains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13235539_10154257171684216_1402750838450853989_o.jpg"

&lt;p>After a little lie in and still feeling full from last night&amp;rsquo;s meal, we shared a leftover danish pastry that we brought back from Laura&amp;rsquo;s Bakery yesterday to start us off for the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sun was shining and the forecast showed it would be warm all day so we planned to be outside till late. We walked through Frederiksberg to the Forum metro (we wanted to try the underground), and hopped off near Nyhavn.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Nyhavn was just like the postcard photos, beautiful brightly painted buildings and busy cafes along the harbour. We walked a slow loop around the harbour. The Copenhagen marathon was on too so it was very busy but there was a great buzz around.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started to get thirsty but thought it would be cheaper to avoid the expensive places on Nyhavn so we headed toward the &lt;a class="link" href="http://designmuseum.dk/en/information/cafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Designmuseum cafe&lt;/a>. We passed Amalienborg by chance, and were lucky enough to be there just as they were doing the changing of the guard. The Designmuseum cafe was a much needed break - a slice of chocolate cake and lots of water - and we sat outside in the gorgeous courtyard in the sun.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Carrying on northwards our next stop was Kastellet. We had a sit on the grass by the water whilst watching the marathon runners go past. We walked through the star-shaped military fortress. The buildings were painted red which looked great against the blue sky and we stumbled upon the windmill which was cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13243934_10154080808541399_7826212685785392186_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we were so close to &amp;lsquo;The Mermaid&amp;rsquo; we wandered over on the way back. It was as expected, with lots of tourists. Next up was Christianshavn - in particular the &lt;a class="link" href="http://copenhagenstreetfood.dk/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Copenhagen Street Food market on Papirøen&lt;/a> (this was one of the first places I found when researching Copenhagen). We looked to jump on a boat bus across but it was a 40 minute wait so we walked most of the way with a one stop hop on the metro.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13247810_10154257168239216_2585725961717198208_o.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Christianshavn"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a LOT of choice at the market and we must have walked 5 laps before deciding on Korean food (bibimbap), followed by nutella cheesecake and vitamin boost juice. All very tasty! The prices were pretty high though, I think I slightly preferred the meatpackers market yesterday. We did get to eat the cheesecake sitting on the edge with our feet dangling over the water, watching the boats pass for around an hour. There was also a duck fight on the water which people tried to split up - they were vicious!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13305236_10154257168284216_4038922425327395377_o.jpg"

&lt;p>Feeling rested and full, we were ready to move again and we wandered in to Christiana (aka Freetown Christiana). It was an interesting place to explore, with DIY houses and an interesting mix of people. Christiana is described as a large commune which is regulated by a special &amp;lsquo;Christiana Law&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13247696_10154080942176399_3022751071551111425_o.jpg"

&lt;p>It was now late afternoon and so we decided it was time to catch a bus to &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tivoligardens.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tivoli&lt;/a>. I was super excited about this part of the trip as I love rides and had heard this was a must-do when in Copenhagen. The tickets were quite pricey (we went with the unlimited rides ones), but I think it was definitely worth it. The first thing we did was find the nearest grassy area and had an hour long nap! We needed an energy boost before going on the rides ;). One of my favourite rides was &amp;lsquo;The Roller Coaster&amp;rsquo; - one of the oldest running wooden roller coasters in the world. We went on the Star Flyer at sunset, which had spectacular views swinging round from 80 metres in the air! We ate burgers for dinner and went on all of the rides multiple times (no queues!). We stayed for the light show, which I think is run every night, it was a great end to a fantastic day.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tomorrow was our last day, but since our flight wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the evening we had a full final day of exploring to do (and of course more eating).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>72 Hours in Copenhagen: Day 1</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/72-hours-in-copenhagen-day-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 19:26:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/72-hours-in-copenhagen-day-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Our long weekend trip to Copenhagen began with a flight from Edinburgh with Ryanair. The flights were under £50pp return, and took less than 2 hours (enough time for a couple of podcasts).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We arrived around 10pm and bought a 72 hour city pass, which came in really handy, and used this to get the train to Copenhagen central station. After a short walk, passing lots of restaurants and bars filled with people sitting outside, we arrived at our &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3575856" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Airbnb in Vesterbro&lt;/a>, just off the pretty &amp;lsquo;small Paris&amp;rsquo; Værnedamsvej. The apartment was lovely and our host gave us some great recommendations. We crashed out not long after, looking forward to waking up here and dreaming of breakfast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Saturday // Day 1&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started the day at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.granola.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Granola&lt;/a>. It was at the end of the street we were staying at, and I&amp;rsquo;d read about it online and in the lonely planet guide so it seemed a good first spot for breakfast. It was pretty early and already very busy; we had seats at the bar with a view in to the kitchen. I went for Skyr with honey and granola and Jon chose scrambled eggs with rye bread. Since it was so busy we had a very long wait (even for our coffees), and when the food did arrive Jon was missing his bread and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t till we&amp;rsquo;d finished eating that they brought it out. The food was great but unfortunately the service not so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13301316_10154257164189216_4585914634068669373_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After feeling fuelled up, we popped in to a couple of shops and took a stroll along the three lakes in to town. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to buy a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.fjallraven.co.uk/equipment/kanken" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fjällräven Kånken&lt;/a> for a while, and planned a stop in to the flagship Copenhagen store for our trip. I came out with two rucksacks - the Kånken and also the High Coast 24 daypack (for light hikes). Jon encouraged me to get the second ;).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With a caffeine buzz we carried on walking in to the centre towards Rundetaarn (the round tower). We paid around £5 for entry, and made the spiral ascent (no steps!) to the top for the views. On our way back down they were getting ready to close as there was a unicycle race to the top starting soon after. We wandered in to a few shops (Weekday, Tiger, etc) and jumped on a bus to the Meatpacking District.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13248562_10154257165319216_1466719634394486478_o-1.jpg"

&lt;p>It was around 4ish and we were getting hungry. The sun was shining and there was a great buzz in the market (&lt;a class="link" href="http://koedbyensmadogmarked.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Kødbyens Mad &amp;amp; Marked&lt;/a>). We bought some drinks, Belgian fries and Vietnamese spring rolls from the stalls and sat on the benches listening to music and people watching. Our Airbnb host recommended this market and we were so glad we went.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A short walk back to our apartment and we ended up napping for an hour or so, before freshening up and catching a bus out to &lt;a class="link" href="http://hostvakst.dk/host/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Höst&lt;/a> for dinner. We made a reservation a few weeks ago and we were super excited to try new Nordic cuisine. We decided to treat ourselves to &amp;lsquo;An Evening at Höst&amp;rsquo;, which came with wine pairings and lots of surprise dishes in between courses. The food was incredible and the atmosphere was beautiful. We caught a bus back to our apartment and slept very well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Maldives was exactly what we wanted for our honeymoon. Full relaxation on a beautiful tropical island, with blue skies and the clear Indian Ocean. It was even better than I imagined it would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We flew from Glasgow to Male with Emirates, with a short stopover in Dubai. We watched a lot of movies during the flights and the food was pretty good - especially the afternoon tea with scones on our flight home. We booked our honeymoon a &lt;a class="link" href="http://yayfryday.com/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>few months back&lt;/a> with &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.purelymaldives.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Purely Maldives&lt;/a>, who were fantastic the whole way through and offered us the best deal on flights and accommodation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first two nights were spent in a deluxe beach villa at the all-inclusive &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.oblu-helengeli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Oblu by Atmosphere at Helengeli&lt;/a>. It was just a short speedboat ride away from Male which was lovely and refreshing. The island was beautiful, with the added bonus of a house reef so we could snorkel from the shore. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a small island which was nice, and all of the staff were excellent. We ate nutella waffles whilst watching the fishes and rays in the sea, snorkelled alongside a blacktip reef shark, drank cocktails, played outdoor table tennis, ate wedding cake, and said &amp;rsquo;this is incredible&amp;rsquo; a lot.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After Oblu we moved to &lt;a class="link" href="https://atmosphere-kanifushi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Atmosphere Kanifushi&lt;/a> for five nights. The island is only accessible by seaplane and it was a great experience (though very hot!) and made the greeting on the island even more special. Champagne was waiting for us at reception and in our sunset beach villa. The island felt very luxurious, and it was quite different to Oblu as it was a fair bit bigger, though it still felt very quiet and secluded. The all inclusive here was fantastic, with a mini bar filled twice a day with food and drinks and a choice of places to eat and activities. The outdoor whirlpool bathtub was perfect to relax in and it was lovely to have a private bit of beach tucked away in front of the villa. We watched the sunset in the sea or on the beach each night, ate lobster, went on a sunset cruise, visited a nearby island dedicated to coral research, had a couples massage, snorkelled with fish including lionfish and unicornfishes, drank mojitos, went sea kayaking, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get over how beautiful these islands are.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hoorah we are married! It was a dream come true to marry Jon surrounded by our family and friends, and we both had such a fun day - it really was the best day ever for us. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some of the details here and a big thank you to everyone for being a part of our special day.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>######The Venue
I wrote &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> about choosing our wedding venue, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>House for an Art Lover&lt;/a>. It was perfect for our relaxed wedding, and the team (in particular Robert) were excellent and made sure the day ran smoothly.
We stayed nearby to the venue the night before - Jon with his groomsmen &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/7834217" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> and I stayed with my bridesmaids &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3345932" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. We all went for dinner the night before which was nice for everyone to meet properly before the wedding. Both houses were Airbnbs and were excellent, and great for getting ready in the morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Bride
I chose &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.maggiesottero.com/maggie-sottero/farah/8230" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my dress&lt;/a> last summer, which I wrote about previously &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. I found and tried on the dress in Cardiff (it was on display in the bridal shop window), but I bought it from &lt;a class="link" href="http://emma-roy.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Emma Roy&lt;/a> up here in Edinburgh. I wanted a dress that was quite simple (not big!) and light, and I loved the detailing to the the top and back. My fittings weren&amp;rsquo;t until the month of the wedding, but luckily it didn&amp;rsquo;t need any alterations except the hem and I had a bustle added in so the train could be lifted for dancing.
I skipped a veil and jewellery since the dress had enough detail with sparkles and pearls, and I wore &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.rainbowclub.co.uk/harlow-peep-toe-satin-shoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Rainbow Club&lt;/a> peep toe shoes that I picked up in John Lewis. My hair and make up was done by Lyn Mckenzie and it was exactly what I was looking for - simple and fresh with a pink smokey eye. Lyn also did two bridesmaids and my mum&amp;rsquo;s hair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Groom
Jon wore a suit from &lt;a class="link" href="http://eu.suitsupply.com/en_GB/suits/lazio-blue-plain/P4123.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Suitsupply&lt;/a>. He ordered a couple of different ones online and decided on the navy Lazio which fit great and he looked fantastic on the day. He wore &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dunelondon.com/boycy-punch-hole-and-toe-cap-detail-leather-shoe-0272507490002511/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>tan shoes&lt;/a> from Dune, a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Brown-Contemporary-Belt/40966,en_GB,pd.html?cgid=Mens-Belts-braces&amp;amp;start=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>leather belt&lt;/a> from T.M.Lewin, and a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.asos.com//Asos/Asos-Slim-Tie-In-Pink-Marl-Effect/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=5983749" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>white pocket square&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.asos.com//Asos/Asos-Tie-Bar-In-Slim-Fit/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=4315199" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>slim tie bar&lt;/a> from ASOS. Oh and also some &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Navy-Pink-Large-Spot-Socks/55573,en_GB,pd.html?cgid=Mens-Socks-boxers&amp;amp;start=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>navy and pink polka dot socks&lt;/a> to finish it all off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Decor
Since the venue was so beautifully decorated with lots of detail already we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to do much in terms of decor. The colours we were going with were grey, navy and blush/peaches. So &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.littlebotanica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the flowers&lt;/a> were made up of peach and blush roses with small white tete-a-tete daffodils (Jon &amp;amp; I are both welsh and wanted to incorporate some welsh things - also they smelt amazing), the groomsmen were in navy suits and the bridesmaids in grey dresses. For the tables we had white roses in fishbowls (provided by the venue) and on the long top table we had small vases of white daffodils.
All of the DIY bits were made the week before the wedding. I made the table names using &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/30151035/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>IKEA Tolsby frames&lt;/a> by hanging handmade origami cranes in grey, pink and cream along with the table numbers at the bottom. We framed an &amp;lsquo;order of the day&amp;rsquo; and made an instagram hashtag (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yayfryday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>#yayfryday&lt;/a>) sign in photoshop by adapting our &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2016/02/26/wedding-invites-diy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>wedding invite&lt;/a> design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Guest Book
We had a polaroid guest book, where we used a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/gifts/home-and-kitchen-gifts/photo-albums-scrapbooks/kraft-medium-slip-in-album-4x6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Paperchase photo album&lt;/a> for guests to slip in a polaroid taken on the Fujifilm Instax 210 (borrowed from my work) and write a note on some kraft cards we had set up with sharpies. We also put some &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gingerray.co.uk/bh-721-photo-booth-props-boho.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ginger Ray photobooth props&lt;/a> around the guestbook and another IKEA frame with instructions on what to do. We weren&amp;rsquo;t sure how well the guest book would go down as we read that often people need encouraging to use them - but people were queueing up to add to it which was great! We now have a book full of photos and messages that we can look back on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Food &amp;amp; Drink
The venue included a three course reception meal followed by coffee and tablet, and the food was excellent. We also had lots of wine, fizzy wine and soft drinks as part of our drinks reception and with the speeches/meal. In the evening we had a buffet but most of us were still pretty stuffed from the meal to eat much!
Our &lt;a class="link" href="http://mimisbakehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>cake&lt;/a> was made up of three flavours - red velvet on the bottom, then oreo, and victoria sponge on top - and decorated with buttercream roses on top. The three cakes were bought separately and we purchased a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.windsorcakecraft.co.uk/windsor_three_tier_spiral_stand.html?category_id=275" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>three tier cake stand&lt;/a> to place them on and added a Ginger Ray &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gingerray.co.uk/pp-621-cake-bunting-pastel-perfection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>cake topper&lt;/a>. The cakes were delicious and we saved some money doing it this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Photographer
We chose &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.neilthomasdouglas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Neil&lt;/a> after bookmarking his website a while back. We loved his informal, relaxed and candid style of photography. He was fantastic on the day and we had a lot of comments from people that they thought he was great. We can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see all of the photos - we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few sneak peeks already and they look fab (the photo at the top of this post is one)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Dancing
In the evening we had a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ceilidhminogue.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ceilidh&lt;/a>. It was so much fun, especially since almost all of our guests hadn&amp;rsquo;t been to one before (including myself), and after the first song the band realised we were definite beginners as it was carnage with everyone going in different directions. After that first song they kept things simple but also challenging enough for us, especially as it got later on in to the night! It kept everyone entertained and we were so glad we chose to have a ceilidh. The band did some DJing as well where they took requests which somehow ended up with the majority of the room doing the macarena at one point&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wedding plans are coming along nicely (and slowly), so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a bit here on where I&amp;rsquo;m at currently. We have the venue, the dress, the website and the honeymoon sorted. We also chose our wedding party and picked a colour scheme (navy, peach/blush and grey - the venue has lots of purples too). I won&amp;rsquo;t mention what we still have to do as the list is frighteningly long (I&amp;rsquo;m using Trello to keep me organised), but we have most of the big things sorted so there is less of an urgency for the other bits!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Venue: &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>House for an Art Lover, Glasgow&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2015/10/hfal.JPG"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before anything else we concentrated on the venue. We looked in Scotland and Wales, and in the end decided on House for an Art Lover. The house is beautifully decorated, there are surrounding gardens, there&amp;rsquo;s a different room for each part of the wedding (ceremony, reception and evening), and it came in under our budget. We have visited the house a few times now and each time we discover something new, there are so many little details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dress: Undisclosed (sorry!)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2015/10/IMG_3831-1.JPG"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding the dress was a relief, and it was fun to try on different types of dresses. I looked in Edinburgh and Cardiff, with the help of my mum, sister and friend. I was stuck between 2/3 and chose the one that stayed in my mind the most. It will be delivered to the store in January and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to try it on in my size! The dress above was one the assistant really wanted me to try on - not the one I chose - don&amp;rsquo;t worry I&amp;rsquo;m not giving anything away :P.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Website: &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.frywedding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>frywedding.com&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2015/10/website.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="website screenshot"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We put together a website that holds some key information which we&amp;rsquo;ll also add the RSVP on to once the invites are sent out. It was fun to put together, and we thought it would be a nice way to introduce our wedding party etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Honeymoon: The Maldives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2015/10/Beach-OBLU-by-Atmosphere-Helengeli-Maldives.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first we found it tough as there were so many options, so one day we went out for lunch and to a coffee shop armed with travel magazines and the macbook. Five days later we booked our honeymoon! At the moment I&amp;rsquo;ve been addicted to watching youtube videos of snorkelling/scuba diving around the island. We are going all inclusive and staying in a beach villa - it looks incredible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just under 5 months to go..!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon and I spent last weekend in London. We stayed just one night at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/united-kingdom/hilton-london-tower-bridge-LONTBHI/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tower Bridge&lt;/a> and travelled by train from Edinburgh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was our first overnight trip to London together and we planned to eat, see some sights and shop. We did all three in 26 hours, and napped on the train journey home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our trip was led by food with the sightseeing and shopping in between. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went (or skip to the photos below):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brunch at The Breakfast Club. Prosecco spritzers at Borough Market. A walk along the river to the Millennium Bridge passing The Clink and Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Globe. Walk around Westminster to Covent Garden. Burger and shake at Shake Shack. Shopping. Dinner at Rossopomodoro, Hoxton. SLEEP. Breakfast at Jamie&amp;rsquo;s Italian (it came with the room). Second breakfast at the Sky Pod Bar in the Sky Garden. Walk along the river passing the Tower of London and over Tower Bridge. Window shopping. Pizza at Homeslice in Neal&amp;rsquo;s Yard.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weekend was Jon&amp;rsquo;s birthday weekend (hooray!) and we spent our Saturday in East Lothian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started the day at Seacliff beach (they normally have a barrier charging £2 per car for parking but it was broken). The drive from Edinburgh was lovely, passing through fields of rapeseed, and the sandy beach at Seacliff was nice and quiet. There are great views of Bass Rock and Tantallon castle here, somehow this was our first visit (and will not be our last). We went for a walk along the rocks, past the teeny harbour, towards the castle.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Late afternoon we drove to North Berwick. I had pre-bought tickets for the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.seabird.org/boats/three-islands-seabird-seafari/14/159" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Three Islands Seabird Seafari&lt;/a> RIB trip and the weather was perfect for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The highlight for me was the puffins on Craigleith Island. The volume of gannets on Bass Rock was amazing too, and it was a good idea to put the hood from the waterproofs up as there were a lot of birds flying above us! It was so much fun, we want to do the Isle of May trip next.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The alarm went off on Sunday and we jumped to the end of the bed to open the blinds. It was still pretty dark outside but as our eyes adjusted we could make out a white triangle - the Matterhorn!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We packed our bags and headed for the train station lockers. It was amazing to see the mountains that were surrounding the town, it felt so different to the day before. Since the weather was so nice we decided we would take the Gornergrat train up to the top of the mountain. It was so worth it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was -17C at the top but the sun definitely helped. We hiked down from &lt;strong>Rotenboden &amp;gt; Riffelberg&lt;/strong>. This was an interesting hike as it turned out we were on a snowshoe trail (the walking trail was hidden under the snow). We came across another walker who was as confused about the trail as we were and it seemed we were way off track. We were trying to find the Riffelsee lake (which we later discovered was just buried under the snow). It was a fantastic walk regardless (although I did step thigh deep in snow twice, Jon had to help me out!).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At Riffelberg we sat in the sun with a drink and a toblerone (we couldn&amp;rsquo;t help ourselves!), before taking the train back down to Zermatt and catching the train on to Visp and onwards to Basel. (We stocked up on chocolate &amp;amp; fondue before we left too)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few weeks ago Jon &amp;amp; I took a 2-night trip to Zermatt. It was our first trip to Switzerland together and it was beautiful. We flew cheap with Easyjet to Basel and travelled down to Zermatt by train using Swiss transfer tickets. We stayed in a lovely &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/869728" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>airbnb studio apartment&lt;/a> on the river with views of the Matterhorn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two days (Friday &amp;amp; Saturday) were foggy and snowy &amp;amp; visiblity was very poor. On Friday evening we explored the car free village and cooked rösti with gruyere, finished off with swiss chocolate (of course ;)).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We layered up for a full day out hiking, and checked which trails were open. We decided on the loop &lt;strong>Zermatt &amp;gt; Z&amp;rsquo;mutt &amp;gt; Furi &amp;gt; Zum See &amp;gt; Zermatt&lt;/strong> for our first hike with a lunch stop at &lt;a class="link" href="http://chalet-altesse-restaurant-zumsee.ch/en/restaurant-zumsee-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Restaurant Zum See&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hike was a little tiring in parts (especially when the snow was blowing in our faces) but it was good to breathe in the fresh mountain air and do some exploring. A friendly ginger cat lead us from Z&amp;rsquo;mutt almost to Furi (we actually had to run away from it so it would stop walking with us&amp;hellip;). If we stopped walking it would start meowing at us to hurry up! Lunch at Zum See was amazing, I ate croute au fromage with bacon and tomatoes (sooo good) and Jon had rösti with bacon and eggs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the afternoon we hiked &lt;strong>Zermatt &amp;gt; Findeln &amp;gt; Zermatt&lt;/strong>. There were a lot of switchbacks and we had to dodge the tobogganers coming down the trail. It was a lovely walk and we made it back down just before sunset.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I still can&amp;rsquo;t get over this place. We drank champagne in the hot tub under the stars, ate great steaks, relaxed in the sauna, sat by the fire, and watched deer in the fields whilst in the double roll top bath.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon proposed on Saturday morning when the sun was still rising. I was in my pyjamas and wondered why he was wearing a shirt. Though we both knew it would happen soon I was still surprised when it actually happened. We could not stop smiling and spent the rest of the day dancing around. It was better than I could ever have imagined and I am so excited to marry my best friend and become Mrs Fry.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last weekend Jon &amp;amp; I went up north to Loch Tay with 2 of our friends and their black labrador pup. This was our second time staying in Loch Tay (we stayed in a beautiful cottage there for our anniversary last year), it&amp;rsquo;s a lovely location with lots to do in the area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stayed in a 2 bedroom cottage (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3825964" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this one&lt;/a>) which had views over the lake, it&amp;rsquo;s own private beach and a games room with a table tennis table. We played board games, sat by the fire, cooked in the fantastic kitchen and went walking by the lake and up in to the mountains. There was no TV and I had no phone signal, so it was a complete retreat away from screens and it felt so good.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This time I played with the advanced options in Guide mode. I can see this being a really useful feature to help learn how some of the manual modes work. I also tried out different release modes and zoom.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I still have a very long way to go, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what half of the buttons do. It was fun to just play around with the camera and see what it could do with some of the more simple settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was such a nice evening it was hard not to get some decent photos up on the hill with the great views over Edinburgh. I love how the leaves are beginning to turn brown too.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of August Jon and I went on a trip up north to Glencoe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neither of us had visited Glencoe before. On the drive up I read a bit about the history (the massacre of Glencoe) and we planned what we were going to do. We had picked out a walk the day before (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/buachailleetivebeag.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Buachaille Etive Beag&lt;/a>) that would cover two munros.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The drive in to Glencoe was fantastic. We arrived at the tiny campsite and quickly pitched our tent. There was a crazy amount of midges, and so there was a lot of running around and flapping about. As soon as the tent was up we ran for the car and headed straight to Glencoe village for some midge repellent. I counted 21 midge bites on my face alone&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Sep/3IMG_1958-copy.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we were quite tired after the terror of the midges, we decided we&amp;rsquo;d go for a drive down the Glen Etive minor road to Loch Etive. It was a lovely drive (this road featured in Skyfall) and we stopped off along the way to enjoy the views. We ate lunch at Loch Etive and we didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter any more midges.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After arriving back at our tent after eating dinner we settled in for the night. We then realised that we had left our bag full of our clothes and toiletries back at our flat!! So we had no walking clothes with us&amp;hellip; so no munros were to be bagged the next day :( I think it must&amp;rsquo;ve been really early when we fell asleep as we were both wide awake at 6am ready to start the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Sep/3IMG_1961.JPG"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We packed up the tent and headed straight to the car park by the three sisters. We hiked up to the lost valley which was really fun and quite a scramble! We spotted an eagle circling up high too. It was a great walk and we were the only people there. We were back at the car by 10:30 and on the road to Edinburgh shortly after.&lt;/p>

Each time it would rain (that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of times) I&amp;rsquo;d say that I&amp;rsquo;d buy a new pair of shoes at the weekend. 6 months later and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally done it with these tan leather shoes.&lt;/p>

Two days later I was onboard and I sorted through everything, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I realised that I could no longer put off buying shoes, so the next day I went to Princes St. My feet will be so thankful, especially with all these rainy days. Time to sell/donate/get rid of lots of clothes and fill out my Autumn capsule some more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We had around 2 hours to spend on Inchcolm. We had a picnic, wandered around the abbey and ran away from the dive-bombing seagulls. Jon was lucky enough to spot a puffin fly past, and there were lots of seals sunbathing on the rocks. We wished we had longer to explore more of the island, although it was a very hot day so we were glad to get back for an ice-cream!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last weekend my Dad came up to visit us in Edinburgh. Since he&amp;rsquo;s been to Edinburgh a few times we decided to venture out to places just outside of the city. On Saturday we went to Rosslyn Chapel and Sunday we went on a boat to Inchcolm Island (more on that later). It was a really fun weekend!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon and I had stopped by at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.rosslynchapel.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Rosslyn chapel&lt;/a> a few years ago, but we never went inside and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the outside since it was covered in scaffolding and a huge umbrella (which was being used to dry out the chapel&amp;rsquo;s walls and roof). It&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting place, made extra famous by The Da Vinci Code, with a mass of intricate carvings everywhere. The guides also do talks inside the chapel, with lots of interesting stories including the &amp;lsquo;Apprentice Pillar&amp;rsquo; and the crazy theories people have about what lies in the buried vaults (Elvis?!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A very mysterious place and one that I&amp;rsquo;d recommend visiting! (I have no photos of the inside as photography wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are 282 Munros in Scotland and this is our second (&lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/08/29/ben-lomond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ben Lomond&lt;/a> was our first). Ben Vorlich is 985m (3,232ft) high. We parked the car at Loch Earn and followed the trail in almost a straight line up to the top. It was a fairly steady climb, although the final climb is pretty rocky and steep. I was very slow at going down this part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was very chilly at the top, which was refreshing after how hot I had felt on the way up.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon and I have been in this flat in Edinburgh for just over 8 months now. And we love it! The high ceilings and big windows are my favourite and there&amp;rsquo;s so much space (we even have some empty cupboards/drawers still!).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few weeks back Jon and I went mountain biking at &lt;a class="link" href="http://7stanesmountainbiking.com/Glentress---Innerleithen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>7Stanes Glentress&lt;/a>. We went to celebrate his 24th birthday (hooray!) and it was so much fun. I was pretty nervous about going since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been cycling for a couple years (not since I&amp;rsquo;d fallen off in Greece) and never been mountain biking before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Glentress has won many awards and is one of the best biking centres in the UK. It is made up of various colour coded trails for different abilities. It&amp;rsquo;s only less than an hours drive away from Edinburgh and we hired bikes from the centre when we arrived. We stuck with the green (easy) routes which were a lot of fun, and tried part of a blue route but it terrified me!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We both really enjoyed it and although I couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk the next day I would definitely go back!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>London. Two weekends ago I took a trip to London to visit a Uni friend. It was &lt;em>so much&lt;/em> fun. We went out Saturday night and slept until 12 on Sunday. We did some sightseeing, had lunch at an Indian cafe in Covent Garden, ate cookies, and (window) shopped.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last week was my Birthday week (hooray!) and I celebrated with a fantastic break in Berlin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are some of my favourite things that Jon &amp;amp; I did whilst in Berlin:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Feb/Berlin1.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="Explore Berlin"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Explore.&lt;/strong> The views from the Reichstag dome. Getting our bearings and learning a little history on the free Sandemans Berlin tour. Shopping along Kurfürstendamm. Photoautomat photobooths. Many of the incredible historical sites. The transport system. Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day at the zoo. Trying to use our A-Level German skills. Kreuzberg. Tiring out our feet wandering in the sunshine. Resting our feet with a coffee and cake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Feb/berlin2.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="Eat Berlin"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Eat.&lt;/strong> Taking a French step back in time at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.restaurant-heising.de/Restaurant_Heising/Willkommen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Heising&lt;/a> (just incredible). Street food. Currywurst. Southern Germany&amp;rsquo;s version of mac &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; cheese (kässpätzle). Chocolate at Fassbender &amp;amp; Rausch. Wild boar ribs in &lt;a class="link" href="http://lokal-berlin.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Lokal&lt;/a>. Burgers in an old toilet at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.burger-meister.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Burgermeister&lt;/a>. Apfelstrudel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Feb/Berlin3.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="Berlinale Berlin"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Film Festival.&lt;/strong> Berlinale. Seeing the most bizzare French film. Discovering we had tickets to an international premiere. Pretending to be celebrities walking down the red carpet. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Boyhood&lt;/a>. Applauding the director and cast on stage. The buzz around Potsdamer Platz. People watching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Berlin, you were so good to us.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday Jon &amp;amp; I, along with our friends Nat &amp;amp; Mike, set off to Loch Lomond for some hill walking. We parked up at Rowardennan to tackle Ben Lomond. The &amp;lsquo;Munro&amp;rsquo; is 974 m (3196 ft) high, making it the highest mountain we&amp;rsquo;ve walked up together. We were prepared for rain as always, but instead the sun was out the whole time and I ended up coming home with sunburnt arms&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went up via the &amp;rsquo;tourist route&amp;rsquo; and ended up going back down the same way (around 12km). We were so low on water and with the sun out we wanted to get back as soon as possible. Next time, for sure, we will take the CamelBak out with us. It was a pretty tough walk in parts during the ascent, but the way back down was so much better we were all pretty much running down it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/benlomond1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1942" alt="benlomond1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/benlomond1.jpg" width="490" height="1794" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the top we could see Ben Nevis in the distance. This was a fantastic walk and great practice for us.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday, Jon &amp;amp; I headed out for the Pentland hills for some hill walking. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been hill walking in a while, and since we are planning on walking up Ben Nevis by next Summer we thought we should get back into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We parked up at Flotterstone and did the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks Short Route&lt;/a>, a nice 10km/3hrs 30mins loop. I always try and print out the planned route before we go - Bing maps have an Ordnance Survey layer which is great and of course free!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1937" alt="pentlands2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t so great - one minute the sun was shining and the next it was pouring down. It was also super windy on the hills. I was almost blown away! The views were fantastic and we shall have to come back to do the 18km route in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1936" alt="pentlands1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands1.jpg" width="490" height="1793" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since the weather&amp;rsquo;s been so great lately, Jon and I decided to make the most of it and go on a little camping trip in Scotland. Our friends recommended &lt;a href="http://www.lochlomond-trossachs.org/visiting/sallochy-campsite/menu-id-335.html" target="_blank">Sallochy campsite&lt;/a> at Loch Lomond, they&amp;rsquo;ve stayed there 3 times in the last couple of weeks! It&amp;rsquo;s around 1.5hrs drive from Edinburgh and you have to book a pitch online for £5 per person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went Friday night after Jon finished work and arrived by 8pm. It was the first time using our new Vango tent which we bought last weekend off gumtree for £20. Luckily we managed to get it up OK and get the barbecue on the go within an hour :) We stayed at one of the lochside pitches which was fantastic, just a few steps from the beach which was secluded into little coves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1908" alt="lochlomond1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond1.jpg" width="490" height="733" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were out in our shorts until 11pm and it was still so bright. We got attacked by the midges and woke up to see the little pink midge bites all over us! It was pretty chilly in the night and morning. We wrapped up whilst eating our breakfast on the beach before packing up the tent (which took us way longer than pitching it&amp;hellip;) and headed up the road to Rowardennan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1909" alt="lochlomond2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond2.jpg" width="490" height="694" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went for a walk (which was supposed to be a long one but I only brought my sandals with me) along the lake. It was super quiet after just a 5 min walk from the car park. We found an empty beach and ate our lunch admiring the views and listening to the waves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along came a duck and 2 chicks. We threw them some of the crust from our sandwiches, and along came another duck with 7 teeny fluffy chicks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1910" alt="lochlomond3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond3.jpg" width="490" height="734" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will definitely be coming back to Loch Lomond! Hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a nice weekend enjoying the sunshine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I finally have my first ever pair of hiking boots, yay! No more walking up hills in my Hunter Wellies and having sore toes and heels, although they were great at keeping the mud off me. After lots of searching online I went to McArthurGlen in Livingston and tried on a few pairs of boots I&amp;rsquo;d read good things about. In the end I chose these &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/womens/viper-womens-boot-p5978.aspx" target="_blank">Viper Women&amp;rsquo;s Waterproof Hiking Boots&lt;/a> from Mountain Warehouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me they are super comfortable, the grip is great, and they are leather too which is something I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1891" alt="boots" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Sunday we went for a walk to Cramond Island, which is a tidal island, to test out my boots. Jon wore  boots which were left in our flat by a previous tenant! I don&amp;rsquo;t think his boots are waterproof though, so he has been looking for new ones and saw they actually do a &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/mens/viper-waterproof-boot-p7481.aspx?ism=0&amp;amp;cl=BROWN" target="_blank">men&amp;rsquo;s version&lt;/a> of mine!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily the tide was out so we were able to walk across the causeway. It was seriously windy and we could barely hear each other speak. It was a lovely walk with great views of Edinburgh and the Forth Road Bridge. We walked back along the wet beach, at one point I almost got stuck and luckily my boots were tied tight or they might have come off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1892" alt="cramond" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg" width="490" height="1834" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to going for bigger walks in the future and giving these a proper test.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I graduated university on Friday with a first class mathematics degree. My 4 year student chapter is over. I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss my friends. I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss having a good timetable which may include a day off and lie-ins or early finishes. I might even miss the bus journeys and the study sessions in the library with frantic last minute revision. It&amp;rsquo;s been a fun 4 years, filled with so many good memories. All of the exams, midterms and projects caused a lot of stress at times, and sometimes I struggled with motivation to study day and night for the weeks leading up to the final exams. But it was so &lt;em>so&lt;/em> worth it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The past 4 days I&amp;rsquo;ve spent spring cleaning the flat. I&amp;rsquo;ve cleared out so much stuff and made a little money selling a few things. I&amp;rsquo;ve rearranged the bedroom furniture and switched around shelving in the kitchen cupboards. It&amp;rsquo;s kept me busy whilst Jon&amp;rsquo;s been working, and since we are planning to move soon I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be a good time to get it done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the fresh feeling from decluttering. I bought a couple things to replace some old stuff too which is always fun to do! Jon sleeps better now that we have lovely new pillows which we picked out from TK Maxx. We spent 15 minutes in the shop opening bags and feeling each pillow before we decided which ones to buy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bought that aloe vera plant above from &lt;a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/60234647/" target="_blank">IKEA&lt;/a> to replace my cactus that died over winter (I left it by the window and I think it froze to death). It&amp;rsquo;s so cool that you can break off a tip and use the gel on burns (it&amp;rsquo;s even edible apparently!) and it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to care for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also planted those seedlings above 4 days ago and they shot up after just a day. They are organic phacelia seeds that I ordered for free from &lt;a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/supportus/keepbritainbuzzing" target="_blank">Keep Britain Buzzing&lt;/a>. I scattered over just a few of the seeds from the packet but I still overdid it! Bees go crazy for these plants, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to move it outdoors at some point. If our next place doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a garden I may just have to find somewhere to scatter the rest of the seeds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope you are having a great Friday!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our friends Mike and Natalie are Polish, so lucky for us they showed us around and took us to some great places. We flew in to Wroclaw, stayed 2 nights at their family&amp;rsquo;s cabin by a lake, stayed 3 nights in an apartment in Krakow, and finally stayed 2 nights near Wroclaw at Natalie&amp;rsquo;s parents house. It was super fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a few photos  from the trip, firstly of our time at the lovely cabin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/cabin.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1826" alt="cabin" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/cabin.jpg" width="490" height="1452" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went out on a boat in the lake, sunbathed, had barbecues and sat around the fire. It was so peaceful and relaxing. I found out from uni I had achieved a 1st on the second night and celebrated around the fire :) Before we came to the cabin we did a HUGE food shop, bought so much meat and crisps, and we pretty much didn&amp;rsquo;t stop eating the whole 2 days..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After our time at the cabin, we drove down to Krakow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/krakow.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1828" alt="krakow" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/krakow.jpg" width="490" height="1468" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon and I visited Krakow 5 years ago for my 18th birthday, and this time it was Jon&amp;rsquo;s 23rd birthday! Woo! After the 3.5hr journey we arrived at the &lt;a href="http://oldcityapartments.eu/en/?ap=336&amp;amp;id=ap" target="_blank">apartment&lt;/a> and chose our rooms. After we all showered and changed out of our smoke filled clothes, we went for a lovely meal and drinks afterwards. We bought Jon a cake and they brought it out after our meal and everyone sang &amp;lsquo;Happy Birthday&amp;rsquo;, it was so funny.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next couple days we did some touristy stuff including Wawel Castle, Pharmacy Under the Eagle, Krakus Mound, etc. We visited Wedel in the main square twice for hot chocolates (they were so tasty). We also went for lunch to the same place twice since it was really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recommended by Natalie&amp;rsquo;s Aunt the restaurant at &lt;a href="http://www.hotel-francuski.com/#/restaurant" target="_blank">Hotel Francuski&lt;/a> does a special lunch deal which was a bargain. On Saturday it cost 20zl (around £4) for a 3 course meal and fruit drink. We had a vegetable soup to start, a quarter of a chicken each with boiled potatoes and salad for mains, and for dessert we had this peach with cream on sponge thing. All served off a trolley and the meat was carved in to quarters at the table too. Sunday cost 35zl as it had wine included. This time it was chicken soup, followed by pork with mashed potatoes and cabbage, and for dessert we had tiramisu. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t get over how good it all was!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/hotelfrancuski.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1829" alt="hotelfrancuski" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/hotelfrancuski.jpg" width="490" height="688" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our final 2 nights were spent near Wroclaw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/wroclaw.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1831" alt="wroclaw" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/wroclaw.jpg" width="490" height="727" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We spent one day in Wroclaw where we visited the main square and islands. It was super cheap, 4zl for soup and roll and 2zl (20p) for a beer at a place right on the square!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day we spent at Natalie&amp;rsquo;s parents house. It rained a lot. We popped out for a bit to visit a castle where they had been to a wedding reception the week before which was lovely, but the rain didn&amp;rsquo;t stop. We went for a sauna back at their house (there was also one of those wooden tubs with a rope that you pull to tip cold water on yourself when you get out  - so cool) and chilled out. The morning of our last day the sun came back out (boo) so we made the most of it and sunbathed by the pool (!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Had such a great time with everyone, and it was such a nice break to have before Jon started working on Monday. We also picked up a bit of Polish along the way!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Thursday Jon and I drove down to the Lake District. We decided to break the journey from Edinburgh to Cardiff by staying overnight at Grasmere, and on Friday continuing on to Alton Towers and arriving in Cardiff in the evening. It was a 3hr drive to Grasmere and driving through the Lake District was gorgeous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We booked the &lt;a href="http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/grasmere-butharlyp-howe" target="_blank">Youth Hostel&lt;/a> on Monday, and the only one which had private rooms still available was the one in Grasmere. Grasmere is known as the place William Wordsworth lived, and apparently he described it as &amp;ldquo;the loveliest spot that man hath ever found&amp;rdquo;. The youth hostel was in this lovely converted Victorian mansion:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/YHA-grasmere.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1775" alt="YHA grasmere" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/YHA-grasmere.jpg" width="490" height="731" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a great, cheap place to stay. We spotted 3 deer just outside the hostel and lots of rabbits running about. We went for a walk, and having done some research before heading out we decided upon the &lt;a href="http://where2walk.co.uk/lake_district/lake_discoveries/easedale-tarn-from-grasmere/" target="_blank">walk to Easedale Tarn&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1778" alt="easedale" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale.jpg" width="490" height="1439" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a nice and easy walk, although it rained the whole time. I took a few too many photos of lambs along the first quarter of the route (they were so cute!), but as my legs started to get rather wet we sped up the hill along the waterfalls. The views were fantastic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We reached Easedale Tarn, and there were just a few people about so it was nice and quiet. Wish we had waterproof trousers though! On the way back towards Grasmere the ground was very wet and muddy. There were stepping stones almost the whole way which helped a lot (luckily I had wellies on so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad), but some parts it seemed we were walking in a stream!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale-tarn.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1777" alt="easedale tarn" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale-tarn.jpg" width="490" height="1270" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time we got back to the youth hostel we were soaked through and we turned the heating up to full to start drying out our shoes and all of our clothes. Jon had a nap for an hour whilst I read a book, and before we knew it it was dinner time! Which meant we had missed having a look around the village shops. I really wanted to go to the &lt;a href="http://www.grasmeregingerbread.co.uk/" target="_blank">Grasmere Gingerbread Shop&lt;/a>, but a look from the outside had to do instead&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/grasmere-gingerbread.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1773" alt="grasmere gingerbread" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/grasmere-gingerbread.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ate at a pub in Grasmere called The Lamb Inn which was yummy, and finished it off with apple crumble and ice-cream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day we woke up early and headed down to Alton Towers. We were there from 10-5 and luckily it stayed dry the whole time. It was super quiet too, with the longest queue being 15mins. So fun!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/altontowers.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1776" alt="altontowers" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/altontowers.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would love to do some more exploring of the Lake District, hopefully with a bit less rain next time though!&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Union Canal / sun
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We tried a new route today straight from our flat and onto the canal from there. It felt great to have a change of scenery and it made it seem like a shorter distance that way. It also felt easier than the last run. Although very red faced by the end of it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 7 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Wednesday / Union Canal / wind and rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today we had to run a day later than we should have because Jon had exams Monday and Tuesday. I think that made this run harder, as we were both feeling it in our legs today! I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying seeing our progress on the nike+ app, with graphs of our pace etc and how much we&amp;rsquo;ve improved since the beginning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Union Canal / sun&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Again we&amp;rsquo;ve had to wait 3 days till this run, exams getting in the way! All finished now though so we can get back into a better routine. Think we are going to stick with running straight from our flat too, now that we are more confident. Still felt pretty tired at the end of the run. The nike+ app told us we&amp;rsquo;d completed 5k in 32'40&amp;quot;, which would&amp;rsquo;ve included some of the walking. I hope by the end of week 9 we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do 5k running in 30 mins, but even to run 5k straight shall be an accomplishment! :)&lt;/p>

On Friday I had my last ever exam at University. 4 years of studying are over and it's on to the big wide world now! Since I've finished I've been tidying and clearing out the flat, it gets so messy during revision times and I'm so happy to get rid of all of my notes that filled 8 lever arched files. I can now do fun things again - woohoo!!
&lt;p>Hope you are having a great bank holiday weekend :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I&amp;rsquo;d heard some people say that this run is a struggle. After doing the 20 min run it seems like this one will be fine, but that confidence can mean running faster and lead to getting tired quicker. So I made sure to keep it steady and start off slowly, and it went really well. This run was the farthest and quickest of them all that we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded on the nike+ app, getting closer to that 5k!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>On Monday I had my first exam in the morning, so instead we went for a run the next day. It was really windy and it made it quite hard to run on the way out. At around the halfway mark I had a bad stitch which made it a struggle and I felt so tired at the end of it. It makes me nervous for the 25 min run that&amp;rsquo;s coming next!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>It rained today so no nike+. It started off really well, but between 12.5 and 20 mins was the hardest. We kept at a steady pace throughout and pushed through it. Felt good afterwards, and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome to think that 6 weeks ago we were running a minute at a time.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Week 5 already, it&amp;rsquo;s going by so quick. The sun was out today and there were quite a few people along the canal. We passed a lady taking close up photos of something on the ground, and later realised it was probably of newts as we noticed them along the path and made sure not to step on any! I felt quite tired after this run, but I can feel my cardio has improved from week 1 for sure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Monday / Union Canal / windy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>The wind has been so bad these last couple days and it continued today. It made it difficult for our run out but helped with the run back. It was 2 runs of 8 mins each which felt good as after 1 run there was only one more to go! At the end of the run we both felt we had energy to keep going. I love how these runs are breaking up revision, always looking forward to the next one. I&amp;rsquo;m nervous for the next one though as there won&amp;rsquo;t be any walking in between, Jon thinks it&amp;rsquo;ll be fine though so we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Wednesday / Union Canal / rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We did it!! It rained heavily all the way through the run. I had my rainproof coat on with hood up which kept most of the rain off me. Jon&amp;rsquo;s coat isn&amp;rsquo;t waterproof so he had it worse, but regardless of the rain we did the full 20 mins! It actually felt really good. I was worried I would struggle but once we started and got into a rhythm, I felt like I could keep on going. Jon didn&amp;rsquo;t take his phone with the nike+ app on because of the rain (both of our pockets were soaked through after) so we don&amp;rsquo;t know how we did for pace etc, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how next week goes!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Our first 5 min run today. The sun was out and we actually took our gloves off halfway as we started to sweat. Felt really good after the run, and pleased with the progress and improvement since week one. Also, the daffodils are finally coming out!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Out early this morning as we had to park at a pay &amp;amp; display spot last night as there were no spaces left so the car needed moving. Along the canal there were lots of kids and parents doing the school run and commuters cycling so we had to run in single file most of the time. Both of our legs were still aching after we &lt;a title="Walking in the Pentlands" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/04/08/walking-in-the-pentlands/">walked in the Pentlands&lt;/a> on Saturday, so we struggled a bit to keep them moving.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / clouds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Nice and quiet along the canal today. Found this run quite hard, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because for the Thursday runs we always have 2 days of rest before it. I had a stitch on the final run and found it really hard to keep running but I was determined not to stop and made it. I&amp;rsquo;m quite nervous for next week as it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;rsquo;transitional&amp;rsquo; week which transitions from running mixed with walking to just running. Should be able to run 20 mins non-stop by the end of the week. Will see how that goes!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Saturday Jon and I went for a walk in the Pentland hills with our friends Natalie and Mike. The sun came out and it was almost 10°C so we had to make the most of it! We parked near the ski centre and walked up the steep hill, following the Capital View trail. It was really slippery with ice and mud in places and so we slipped a lot on the way down (Natalie in particular) and once you started sliding it was hard to stop!! We are all planning to invest in walking boots in the future :D&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Oh and my legs are still aching&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d make the run today but managed it (just about)!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Holyrood Park / light snow&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today we went for a drive to Holyrood Park for our run and left a little later than usual. I had cereal when I woke up and it was around an hour later we went for the run. So I had a bad stitch during the first run, and when it came to the 3 min run I was really struggling but kept going. Jon thought I was going to cry..! So we paused the podcast after the run for a minute whilst I tried to get rid of it, and when it calmed down we carried on. We decided to try a different route and ended up running up a very steep muddy hill, but by the time we were up my stitch was gone and I had a sudden rush of energy. We were both very tired after and I think from now on I won&amp;rsquo;t eat breakfast until we get back home, and we won&amp;rsquo;t be doing that route again until we are fitter!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 3 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Monday / Union Canal / cloudy
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I didn&amp;rsquo;t eat breakfast before we went out today but took a banana with me for after the run (we are usually up at 8 and out around 8.45ish). We both felt a lot better this time and felt we could keep going on for longer. We noticed that this week takes less time than the previous weeks, and we cover 3.5km compared to 4.1km previously. Excited for the next run!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 3 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / sun and clouds
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today felt warmer as the sun kept peeking out. Sticking with the not eating until we get home which is working out well. We ran alongside a kayak and a canal boat which was cool. Again we felt like we could run more, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we feel about that next week with the longer runs..!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>It was very cold today (as usual)! Ran along the canal again, this time there were a couple rowing boats out which was quite funny as during the walking parts they would overtake us and then the running parts we would overtake them. Jon used his headphones too whilst using the nike+ app which was cool because it let us know whenever we&amp;rsquo;d run a mile. Felt good during/after the run and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We both felt tired today, but we motivated each other to keep on going and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we did. Uni is stressful at the moment (Dissertation due on Thurs!) but we are both finding that running is helping de-stress us and gets us away from a computer and in to the fresh air which can only be a good thing :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I was worried it would be slippy out today but luckily the path along the canal had been cleared. Today was probably the least windy it&amp;rsquo;s been since we began and that definitely helped with the running, the sun even came out at one point! Ran a bit further along the canal until we were on an aqueduct that runs over the Water of Leith. We did a sprint finish on the last run, which tired us both out after! On to week 3&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon and I have begun to run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been into running, whenever I went for a run I&amp;rsquo;d come home and feel so tired that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to go again! I think that made me not enjoy it - pushing myself too hard and feeling defeated. I think the last time I went out for a run was 2 years ago. Then, last week Jon and I were talking about fitness and how we want to get fitter but we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough money to go to a leisure centre blah blah. We enjoy hill walking but that&amp;rsquo;s more of a weekend thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We talked about running and looked at the &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/LiveWell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k.aspx" target="_blank">Couch to 5k plan&lt;/a> that we&amp;rsquo;d heard good things about before but never properly looked into it. The 9-week plan slowly eases you into running, where you begin by mixing running and walking together and slowly build up to running a 5k. And then we decided to do it. 2 days later I bought some budget running shoes and the next day we went for our first run.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then alternate 60 seconds of running and 90 seconds of walking, for a total of 20 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1570" alt="Camera 360" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R1.jpg" width="490" height="653" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Sunday / Holyrood Park / rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Actually ran week 2 run 1. I accidentally put the wrong podcast on my iPod.. oops. But got through it and felt good afterwards, without feeling like my body was melting :) My left heel rubbed a bit in my new shoes, think it&amp;rsquo;s just from wearing them in though. We are both looking forward to our next run!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. the next 2 days both of our legs ached haha we need to keep it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Tuesday / Holyrood Park / snow &amp;amp; wind
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Back on to Week 1 as I&amp;rsquo;ve sorted my iPod out now! The weather was really bad, strong winds and snow made this feel like such a workout. My hands were numb and it felt like I was running backwards when the wind was against me as I was running up a slight incline. Apparently there was a weather warning, but it made it a challenge and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did it! After coming home and having a warm shower it was worth it :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1572" alt="Camera 360" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R3.jpg" width="490" height="653" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / sunshine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Yay the sun came out, although it&amp;rsquo;s still cold around 1°C it felt so much warmer. We tried a different route closer to our flat, it was more sheltered and we both really enjoyed it. Also saw signs that spring is almost here - can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it to get warmer. I felt this run was a lot easier than the last 2, that&amp;rsquo;s probably mainly due to the weather but hopefully I am getting fitter too! Both excited to start week 2 over the weekend!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Do you run? Have you ever tried the C25K plan or similar? &lt;/em>&lt;/p>

I had a fantastic one :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, as I share my birthday with 2 friends (they&amp;rsquo;re twins!), we all went out in Edinburgh to celebrate. I bought a new dress with my birthday cash from ASOS, this one to be precise:&lt;/p>

I also received lots of cool gifts, here&amp;rsquo;s a couple I just had to share (excuse the lack of lighting!)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. The Travel Book: A Journey Through Every Country in the World.&lt;/strong> Where to go next&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;d love to travel around South America, especially Peru!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On my birthday, Jon and I headed into town for lunch. I&amp;rsquo;d read great things about Papii on &lt;a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d2212342-Reviews-Papii-Edinburgh_Scotland.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor&lt;/a> and since it&amp;rsquo;s in the top ten places to eat in Edinburgh it had to be tried!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we were not disappointed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon went with the lemon and coriander chicken sub and I had the mezzano, salami and olive melt. Washed down with a flat white coffee and a very merry berry smoothie. All sooo good. And the coffee art is awesome. Birthday lunches are my favourite and Papii made it even better.&lt;/p>

Time to get back into Uni mode and get through this final push. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling &lt;em>excited&lt;/em> but anxious about graduating this summer. But enough about that, the last 2 weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve spent back home in Cardiff have been awesome and I wanted to share a few photos of my holidays :)&lt;/p>

I had my last exam today and it went really well. I&amp;rsquo;m so relieved to finish studying and know that all my hard work will hopefully pay off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So yesterday was mine and Jon&amp;rsquo;s 7 years-of-being-a-couple anniversary. We&amp;rsquo;re celebrating this weekend by cooking a yummy meal together and allowing ourselves to put the electric heating on ha!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just wanted to share a couple things that I gave Jon, starting with his card and wrap:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4040.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1384" alt="cardwrap" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4040.jpg" width="490" height="243" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/61963605/love-is-exponential-letterpress-card?ref=sr_gallery_9&amp;amp;ga_search_query=cards+love&amp;amp;ga_order=most_relevant&amp;amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;amp;ga_ship_to=GB&amp;amp;ga_page=2&amp;amp;ga_search_type=handmade&amp;amp;ga_facet=handmade/paper_goods/cards/letterpresscards+love" target="_blank">this card&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s cute + math related = yay! It&amp;rsquo;s from &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/FatBunnyPress?ref=seller_info" target="_blank">FatBunnyPress on Etsy&lt;/a> - totally recommended. Also that pacman wrapping paper is just printable paper from &lt;a href="http://www.minieco.co.uk/halloween-printable-wrap/" target="_blank">Minieco&lt;/a> which is free. The site has lots of printable wraps and other cool templates; I want to try making these &lt;a href="http://www.minieco.co.uk/paper-gems/" target="_blank">paper gems&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.minieco.co.uk/3d-paper-diamonds/" target="_blank">diamonds&lt;/a>. Jon gave me origami paper too so they will be getting made!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4042.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1390" alt="book" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4042.jpg" width="490" height="243" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a 7x7&amp;quot; book made from &lt;a href="http://www.blurb.co.uk/" target="_blank">Blurb&lt;/a> of our time in Edinburgh as students. I&amp;rsquo;m so impressed by the quality. I used Bookify to put it all together, just dragged the pics in and played around with the pre-made page layouts, so easy! I think it looks great, and it&amp;rsquo;s something we&amp;rsquo;ll look back on and laugh at (there are a lot of embarrassing photos in there). The majority of pages are made up of photo grids (2x2 and 3x3), and there&amp;rsquo;s 40pages in total. Here are some photos of a few pages, poor lighting doesn&amp;rsquo;t do them justice unfortunately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4043.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1391" alt="photobook" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4043.jpg" width="490" height="1135" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want a good quality photobook, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend &lt;a href="http://www.blurb.co.uk/" target="_blank">Blurb&lt;/a>. I found a 30% off code online too, so have a Google if you fancy getting one for yourselves or as a gift!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope you have a lovely weekend :)&lt;/p>

We went when it was free (over St. Andrew&amp;rsquo;s Day weekend) at 9.30 am on Saturday. It was pretty cold up there but luckily there was lots of places to explore indoors too. I really enjoyed it, especially seeing the sparkly crown jewels :) We spent around 2 hours looking around - a nice study break!&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">2 weeks today = my first exam of four...&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">4 weeks today = Christmas holidays begin!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">The countdown begins, and until then I shall drink lots of tea and eat lots of sugary snacks to keep me going through revision. These are my penultimate exams at university so I'm starting to stress, but I'm looking forward to getting them done and driving back home to Cardiff for Christmas :)&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s now a month till exams and it&amp;rsquo;s starting to really sink in that by April uni will be over, forever. So I&amp;rsquo;m making sure I make the most of it and come out with a good degree, which means most of my time is taken up with studying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I try to keep one weekend day mostly free of work, and today is one of those days :) This morning Jon and I went to the cinema to see a screening of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/" target="_blank">Argo&lt;/a> which was really good (and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it), followed by some food shopping and some online catch-up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a few things I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/cows.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351" title="cows" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/cows.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="656" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went for a walk in the Pentlands with some friends when the sun came out. It was so muddy and we went the steepest possible way up the hill. The way down was particularly funny when everyone slipped in the mud except for me ha! But we do really need to invest in some walking boots :p We also stumbled across this gathering of highland cattle which completely blocked our path, so we patiently waited for them to move as we were too scared to get close!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/rolocookies.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1352" title="rolocookies" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/rolocookies.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I baked &lt;a title="Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/" target="_blank">cookies&lt;/a>, rolo ones, that lasted 2 days at most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/halloween.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1353" title="halloween" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/halloween.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to a Halloween party as a skeleton! The pic on the left was taken a couple of days before the party when I did a trial run of the make-up so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit rough. Was a great party and I only spent £2 on my &amp;lsquo;costume&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/sparklers.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1354" title="sparklers" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/sparklers.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="150" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally today I picked up some &lt;a href="http://www.tesco.com/free-sparklers/free-sparklers.pdf" target="_blank">free sparklers&lt;/a> from Tesco (click the link to get the coupon), a few of us plan on going up Blackford Hill to watch some fireworks tomorrow night, can&amp;rsquo;t wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, I&amp;rsquo;m going to put on the kettle for a hot chocolate and try to apply for some jobs. Have a nice Sunday!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s some pics Jon took on his phone - the Samsung Galaxy S2 - of things we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently (minus the cookie pics which came from my camera). I think some of them came out pretty well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Baking lots of chewy cookies (recipe &lt;a title="Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/George-Heriot-School.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1257" title="Camera 360" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/George-Heriot-School.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="799" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Visiting &lt;a href="http://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/george-heriots-trust-historic-building-p245351" target="_blank">George Heriot's School&lt;/a> as part of Edinburgh's &lt;a title="European Heritage Days" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/european-heritage-days/" target="_blank">Open Door Days&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/corstophinehill1.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260" title="corstophinehill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/corstophinehill1.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Walking around the wooded Corstophine Hill and up the &lt;a href="http://www.corstorphinehill.org.uk/thetower.htm" target="_blank">tower&lt;/a> (which was open as another part of the Open Door Days).&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">When we turned around from that viewpoint above this is what we saw...&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/zebra.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261" title="zebra" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/zebra.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="629" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">..Zebras! Through a large fence is Edinburgh Zoo, which backs on to a path around the hill. We could hear kids shouting from inside the zoo and that's when we noticed that the zebras were right up by the fence near us! Gotta love seeing a herd of zebras whilst walking through the woods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Hope you're having a lovely weekend!&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s our first &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; walk in the Hills and we both really enjoyed it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1214&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;490&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1214" title="allermuir hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326" />&lt;/a> Allermuir Hill (493m)[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got the ski lift going part of the way up which saved our legs a bit of work. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to ride on it before and seeing as &lt;a title="European Heritage Days" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/european-heritage-days/" target="_blank">it was free&lt;/a> it had to be done. Great views at the top of the slopes too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/cvw.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1215" title="capital view walk" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/cvw.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1752" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How cute are those thatched cottages?! The walk passes through the lovely Swanston village, where apparently Robert Louis Stevenson spent his summer days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took us a little over 2 hours to complete the loop, and our legs were aching by the end of it. There were a few steep parts that got our heart pumping. We need to do this more often and would love to do the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks&lt;/a> walk in the future!&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Walked&lt;/em> in the Pentland Hills in the rain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Shopped&lt;/em> in TK Maxx. Jon picked up an outdoorsy coat and I found some glass cups (we only had one left) which we managed to get the price down to 50p per cup!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Watched&lt;/em> 2 free movies at the cinema. Hope Springs and Untouchable - I recommend both, &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/" target="_blank">Untouchable&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Explored&lt;/em> a part of Edinburgh we hadn't been to before. More on that below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Enjoyed&lt;/em> our last week before University begins.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div>[hr]&lt;/div>
The part of Edinburgh we went to was a bit of a spur of the moment thingy. After driving back from TK Maxx, I spotted a sign for the &lt;a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/vc/index.html" target="_blank">Royal Observatory&lt;/a> and thought we should check it out. We drove past the lovely shops in Morningside and through Blackford, past some gorgeous (and huge) houses that we dreamed of living in, and finally up the steep hill to the Observatory.
&lt;p>We parked up and it seemed like we weren&amp;rsquo;t in the city anymore. We were on &lt;a href="http://www.fohb.org/new/index.htm" target="_blank">Blackford Hill&lt;/a> which is a local nature reserve  with fields of grass, crags, a lake and river. So we decided to walk up to the top of hill.  It was such a windy day and at the top I struggled to stand straight! The views from the top were the best I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Edinburgh (a 360° panorama). It was also really quiet, just a few dog walkers and that was it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These photos were taken on my phone so they&amp;rsquo;re pretty bad quality. [Jon&amp;rsquo;s just renewed his phone contract and now has a Samsung Galaxy S2 (woo!) so I can use the camera on that when I don&amp;rsquo;t have my proper camera with me now :D]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1195" title="blackford hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1063" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love finding new places like this. This would be an awesome place to come and watch fireworks or for a picnic in the sun. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised it&amp;rsquo;s not so well known!&lt;/p>

Was great to finally see everyone again and chill out like it was a holiday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/sunflowers.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1171" title="sunflowers" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/sunflowers.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="328" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to share a few pics I took from a couple of days we spent in West Wales along the beautiful &lt;a href="http://www.pembrokeshirecoast.org.uk/default.asp?PID=4" target="_blank">Pembrokeshire Coast&lt;/a>. It was Me, Jon, my dad and bro and we stayed at the &lt;a href="http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/broad-haven" target="_blank">Youth Hostel in Broad Haven&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/wetsuits.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1172" title="wetsuits" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/wetsuits.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="366" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went surfing at Newgale beach. The waves were big and frequent, and the sun was out shining. So much fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/sunset.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1173" title="sunset" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/sunset.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1962" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the evening we had a yummy meal at &lt;a href="http://www.thecambrianinn.co.uk/index.html" target="_blank">The Cambrian Inn&lt;/a> in Solva, then went for a walk along Newgale beach and saw the sunset. It was lovely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/broadhaven.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174" title="broadhaven" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/broadhaven.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="654" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a good nights sleep (and yeh we played the obligatory game of Scrabble in the evening) we found that the weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t so good, so before the rain came we walked to the beach at Broad Haven. We skimmed rocks and my Dad showed us the coal and iron in the cliffs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/kidwellycastle.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1175" title="kidwellycastle" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/kidwellycastle.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="653" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the drive home we stopped off at &lt;a href="http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/kidwellycastle/?lang=en" target="_blank">Kidwelly Castle&lt;/a>. The castle was great but we didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of the statue &amp;lsquo;art&amp;rsquo; that was in there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next time we&amp;rsquo;ll be in Cardiff will be for Christmas. Then it&amp;rsquo;ll only be another 4 months and I&amp;rsquo;ll be graduating. Getting nervous now it&amp;rsquo;s all going to be over so soon! We are both already looking forward to getting back to Wales and seeing everyone again.&lt;/p>

Oh we&amp;rsquo;d love to live somewhere that is sunny all the time&amp;hellip; Today we went for a little drive around Holyrood Park, along Queen&amp;rsquo;s Drive. It&amp;rsquo;s a great one-way road with views across the sea to East Lothian and across Edinburgh itself. There are pull outs along the road and we stopped off at Dunsapie Loch. If you&amp;rsquo;re walking up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat this is probably the best place to park up and walk if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the shortest/easiest route up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/holyrooddrive.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1124" title="holyrooddrive" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/holyrooddrive.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1348" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[BTW my camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t like the sun much]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a walk about, watched the swans and people passing by. We noticed the same cyclist go by us 4 times in a short space of time, and the loop is 3.3miles up and down, go him!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I&amp;rsquo;m home I think I shall make some &lt;a title="Philly with Cadbury Chocolate Cheesecakes" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/philly-with-cadbury-chocolate-cheesecakes/">cadbury philly cheesecakes&lt;/a> (as requested by Jon), watch some TV and think about what to do this week. We are off back to Cardiff next Thursday for 2 weeks - can&amp;rsquo;t wait!!&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go here for a while and the weather today made it an ideal time to go. Plus it&amp;rsquo;s amazingly free of charge, you only have to pay to go in the glasshouses, and there&amp;rsquo;s free parking on the weekends/evenings (or plenty of buses).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We only planned on stopping by for an hour, but ended up staying for longer, although we still only saw around a third of the gardens. We walked through the Chinese Hillside, Rock Garden and Herbaceous Border. There was a wedding reception at the Caledonian Hall opposite the Rock Garden and it looked beautiful, this was probably my favourite garden. There are views of Carlton Hill and Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat here, as well as a waterfall and of course lots of pretty flowers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/rbge.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1117" title="rbge" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/rbge.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1635" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind the Herbaceous Border is a huge beech hedge, we walked through it to these little gardens where fruit and vegetables were growing. There were rows for local primary schools to grow their own too which was cute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It felt like we were somewhere else, it was so peaceful and spacious yet so close to town. I could spend hours wandering around and lazing on the grass. We shall definitely be making future trips here and next time we&amp;rsquo;ll bring a picnic with us, or maybe indulge in an afternoon tea. Even if the weather&amp;rsquo;s bad we could pay to have a wander around the glasshouses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Totally recommend this place if you&amp;rsquo;re in Edinburgh!&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;ve been nervous about getting one since we&amp;rsquo;ve had so many problems in the past and they&amp;rsquo;re so much money, even last night we went to bed kinda swayed to the &amp;lsquo;we won&amp;rsquo;t get one&amp;rsquo; side. But we realised that some of our best memories include a car, and driving about and roadtrips are something we both love.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/newcar.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1107" title="newcar" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/newcar.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="982" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We bought a Ford Puma, mainly for its reliability, and got this one in particular because it was a good deal and had good history and all that stuff. We bought a return train ticket and we were both so nervous, but ended up returning with the car! Exciting times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We drove back and stopped off at &lt;a href="http://www.pentlandhills.org/" target="_blank">Pentland Hills Regional Park&lt;/a> for a little walk by Threipmuir Reservoir whilst the sun popped out of the rain clouds. This is why we chose to buy a car, to make little trips like this that make us smile.&lt;/p>

The reason for this is because we felt like we hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually been &lt;em>doing&lt;/em> much, just kinda hanging about waiting for September to roll around, and so we&amp;rsquo;d have something to look forward to doing each week. I said we should both write down 4 things we&amp;rsquo;d like to do and then show each other to see what we come up with. And so we did, and it turned out that we both had the exact same things down. Perfect! We set a &lt;em>maximum&lt;/em> budget of £25 for each date, as Jon&amp;rsquo;s started to make some money on the side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here&amp;rsquo;s our 4 things:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/IMGP0129.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1065" title="fourthings" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/IMGP0129.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="285" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are both excited about doing stuff together and finding new places to go. We may only be in Edinburgh for one more year so it&amp;rsquo;s about time we started seeing it and going to the places we&amp;rsquo;ve passed by where we&amp;rsquo;d say &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;d love to go there one day&amp;rsquo;. We have short-term things to look forward to and things to work for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to document our date nights/days in a mini book, with photos and bits and pieces like cinema tickets for example. I found &lt;a href="http://www.iloveitallwithmonikawright.com/2011/03/date-night.html" target="_blank">this date night mini book&lt;/a> created by Monica Wright which looks awesome and is the kind of thing I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to achieve, some great ideas there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll just be collecting bits and getting photos together first before I start putting the book together, as I&amp;rsquo;ll need to buy some little bits like cardstock and book rings etc. Once I get started on it I&amp;rsquo;ll put up a blog post. We started our 4 things last night with a meal at &lt;a href="http://www.gustorestaurants.uk.com/restaurants/gusto-edinburgh" target="_blank">Gusto&lt;/a> which was lush, and we are excited about next week!&lt;/p>

We woke up expecting to be going to the &lt;a href="http://www.tasteofedinburgh.co.uk/" target="_blank">Taste of Edinburgh&lt;/a> festival this evening and we were both really looking forward to it. With top restaurants in Edinburgh (incl The Balmoral, Tigerlily and Cucina) and top chefs (incl Fabulous Baking Brothers, Lloyd Grossman, Jason Atherton), it looked to be a great evening out trying out different meals and watching demonstrations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/tasteofedin.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996" title="tasteofedin" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/tasteofedin.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="153" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately we woke up to heavy rain. Overnight the meadows were flooded and we had a text from taste telling us it was cancelled. Wahh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we had some good, totally unrelated, news through the post. It was a letter from my university, which I thought would be the physical copy of my exam results. Instead it was a letter saying I had won an award for outstanding merit of the year along with a £100 cheque! This cheered me up, my hard work studying paid off, wahoo :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we thought we should celebrate and do something since the festival was cancelled. I was kept updated about taste on twitter. Quite a few of the restaurants had special offers for people with tickets which I thought was generous and nice of them. Then I found that &lt;a href="http://markgreenaway.com/live/home.html" target="_blank">Mark Greenaway&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.angelswithbagpipes.co.uk/" target="_blank">Angels with Bagpipes&lt;/a> set up a last minute free pop-up event at Summer Hall serving up their award-winning dishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So yeh we kinda had to go! We went along with Nat and Mike and after a drink and a walk we arrived at the end of a queue. After around 15mins the queue started moving and we were the second batch of people to get in. It felt strange walking in to what seemed like someone&amp;rsquo;s house and it was packed! It was part of Edinburgh Uni&amp;rsquo;s Vet School, so there were a lot of strange things like coloured bubbling cylinders by the bar and other random stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were quite confused with where we were meant to go with people jammed everywhere and being British we felt we had to be in a queue. After switching queues almost three times and nearly walking in to the kitchen we managed to get some scallops with pea puree which was lovely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After ending up outside at a seating area me and Nat decided to try again inside. This time we were a lot more strategic and managed to get desserts of Eton Mess and 2 mains -  11 hour slow roasted pork belly served with puffed crackling, pomme puree and toffee apple jus and a delicious leg of lamb dish. Delicious!!&lt;/p>
&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012" title="toe" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/toe.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1049" />
&lt;p>It was funny to watch people getting food, we felt a bit like seagulls when it came around. One guy had like 10 plates of scallops all to himself (not in one go mind)! There was so much food - I think I had 4 desserts, 2 mains and a starter. The dessert was definitely my favourite, think Jon liked the pomme puree (or mash to us lot) and pork the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a big thank you to everyone involved, especially to Mark Greenaway and Paul Whitecross for their yummy dishes! It&amp;rsquo;s such a shame about the festival being cancelled because of the rain, but we ended up having a great day after all.&lt;/p>

The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good but we wanted to get some fresh air and exercise after a very lazy weekend (think movies and lots of ice-cream). From our flat to the park it&amp;rsquo;s about 2.5miles through Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s old town. We had planned on walking up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat but the ground was quite slippery so skipped it this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988" title="holyrood" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1062" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead we walked along the Salisbury Crags and up to the base of Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat and around in a loop. There were quite a lot of people about, and a few runners covered in mud. We would like to live near here so we could go jogging around the park in the mornings, perhaps one day we will try and jog there and back from our flat (hmm just maybe).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh, it&amp;rsquo;s nice having such a big park so close to the city centre and with great views of the city. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of walks to do in the park, and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it to anyone visiting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989" title="holyrood2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="343" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully the weather will pick up soon, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe we are already in July.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel like yesterday was the beginning of summer. I&amp;rsquo;m not enjoying spending so much time in the flat, especially as I made some calculations and figured we couldn&amp;rsquo;t spend any money until the end of July (next payday) for us to afford rent over summer. So we shall have to start making money other ways and doing as much free stuff to keep us entertained!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we went to Union Canal in Fountainbridge with some leftover crusts of bread. We were soaked by the time we returned home but it feels good once in a while to get out in the rain and not care about being wet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887" title="feedducks" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="531" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny moment when Jon threw some bread, we heard a thump and a pigeon fly right across us, he accidentally hit the poor thing! We felt like kids feeding the ducks, and think we shall go and feed them each time we have old stale bread instead of throwing it in the bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been doing with all these rainy days?&lt;/p>

(And I had an 8-letter word but no R on the board - typical!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrabble.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816" title="scrabble" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrabble.jpg" width="490" height="183" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve made some more progress with my travel scrapbook too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapbook-4.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823" title="scrapbook 4" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapbook-4.jpg" width="490" height="720" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m finally on to &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm" target="_blank">Yosemite NP&lt;/a>, such amazing scenery there we both loved it, a definite must-see if in CA!! I have a lot of pics to fill the next few pages with, and this time I cut one of the pages in half to put the envelope on that holds the leaflets, etc in and it&amp;rsquo;s much sturdier that way (other side shown in the bottom pic painted purple). Wish I did this from the start!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what things do you like to do on a rainy day?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>{Scrapbook peeks are little glimpses of the scrapbook I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together of a &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/category/usa-road-trip" target="_blank">road trip in the US &lt;/a>from last summer.

So me and Jon spent our time on Saturday at Gullane beach and Sunday at the meadows with friends and barbecues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/barbecues.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-734" title="barbecues" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/barbecues.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="925" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this weather lasts, the sun just seems to put everyone in a happy mood. I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You&lt;/a> and so far loving it, I don&amp;rsquo;t want it to end!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beach at Gullane is nice, and luckily our friends have a car so we could get down there easily. From Edinburgh there is a First bus that does go there and other beaches too - the no. 124 I think. Here&amp;rsquo;s a cute pic of Natalie and Mike at the beach :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2957.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-736" title="gullane beach" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2957.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope y&amp;rsquo;all are enjoying the weather too!&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Edinburgh for nearly 3 years and still hadn&amp;rsquo;t been across there even though it&amp;rsquo;s so close. Jon had lots of bday cash to spend so Glasgow was a great choice with so many shops!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP29181.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-718" title="Glasgow trip" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP29181.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="2369" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
We got the &lt;a href="http://www.citylink.co.uk/index.php" target="_blank">citylink&lt;/a> bus from Haymarket to Glasgow which only cost us £6 return with 20% student discount online and took around an hour. Such good timing when we went as the sun was out the whole time.
&lt;p>Jon bought a few things, pretty much everything from H&amp;amp;M - I think we went to 4 different ones and multiple times too. I think he likes it there ha. I used my &lt;a href="http://dwell.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dwell&lt;/a> free £20 voucher and chose a cookie type jar for the kitchen, it has a dog&amp;rsquo;s head on the lid! Struggled a bit to find the shop, it was in the lovely Princes Square, but glad we found it in the end. We did a lot of walking around shops so it was nice stopping for a sitdown and drink - we both loved the passion burst drink at the Fuel Juice Bar - so refreshing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had dinner at T.G.I&amp;rsquo;s and used our &lt;a title="Free(ish) T.G.I Friday’s Juicy Burger" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/freeish-t-g-i-fridays-juicy-burger/" target="_blank">free burger vouchers&lt;/a>, so yummy!! I had the BBQ Smokehouse and Jon had the Monster Burger. We only paid for drinks and dessert, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten that much in a long time, we struggled to walk back to the hotel&amp;hellip; So worth it though!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stayed overnight at the &lt;a href="http://www.citizenm.com/glasgow/" target="_blank">citizenM hotel&lt;/a>, which was really nice and we had fun playing around with the remote that controls everything in the room, including the shower pod colour. Such a big comfy bed too we didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna get up in the morning!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We didn&amp;rsquo;t see much of Glasgow with such short time, but what we did see was great. We&amp;rsquo;d both like to go back and see some more :D&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The sun is shining and things are good. I start a new job tomorrow, Jon is busy making business plans and it&amp;rsquo;s his birthday on Thursday. We are going shopping, eating and drinking in Glasgow (we&amp;rsquo;ve both never been before) and staying the night in a fab hotel. I wish birthdays came more often!&lt;/p>

My final exam was on Monday so I&amp;rsquo;m done with uni for 4 whole months - summer has begun! But sadly the weather isn&amp;rsquo;t agreeing with me on that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/hail.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-672" title="hail" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/hail.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="346" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from the bad weather (it&amp;rsquo;s Britain after all) I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying not having to revise anymore and having time to catch up on tv, etc. This currently consists of HIMYM (ah season finale :o), Gossip Girl (another season finale!), Glee (yes I&amp;rsquo;m a fan), Game of Thrones (crazy), and I&amp;rsquo;ve started rewatching The Shield (watch it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also been busy with my scrapbook and managed to complete 3 pages yesterday. Any guesses at to where these photos were taken? ;) My &lt;strong>scrapbook peek #3&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/scrapbook-3.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-673" title="scrapbook 3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/scrapbook-3.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1019" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally I&amp;rsquo;ve put film in my &lt;a title="My New Diana F+ Camera" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/my-new-diana-f-camera/">new camera&lt;/a> and have started snapping away. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get it developed even if they do turn out bad..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-viewfinder.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-674" title="diana viewfinder" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-viewfinder.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="431" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now I&amp;rsquo;ve got more time on my hands I shall be filling my moleskine up with things I want to do and ideas for the blog. Hopefully things will be getting ticked off a lot more frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and sorry about the amount of brackets used in this post, got a bit carried away!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday we both volunteered at the &lt;a title="Rock ‘n’ Roll Edinburgh Half Marathon" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/rock-n-roll-edinburgh-half-marathon/">Rock &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; Roll Edinburgh Half Marathon&lt;/a>, which was really fun and it was such a nice sunny day. We were over at Holyrood park all morning and after holding rope for the corral starts we ate hotdogs before the runners started to come through the finish line with the female winner after 1hr 16mins! We were working at the chip retrieval where we clipped the chips off people shoes, yum. Was a great day, maybe some time we&amp;rsquo;ll be running it :p&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards we went to Usher Hall to see &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lwxj1/features/banglive" target="_blank">Bang Goes the Theory Live&lt;/a> (not to be confused with the Big Bang Theory)! We managed to get free tickets and it was pretty good. Lots of kids though and I was sat by a boy who couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop jumping up and down in his seat so I was flinging around lol, that was quite annoying after a while&amp;hellip; Was an entertaining show though for all the family and educational too, and the audience were involved which the kids loved. It was my first time inside Usher Hall and it&amp;rsquo;s a really nice venue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Monday - Wednesday Jon had family up to visit which was lovely. It&amp;rsquo;s so good when we have visitors, sucks we are so far away! They were staying in an amazing apartment right in town with heated floors which were so nice and even a garden. Hate how cold our flat is :( There was this mirror in the lounge which I love:&lt;/p>
&lt;img class="aligncenter" title="mirror" src="http://media-cache2.pinterest.com/upload/26529085275208448_hmRtjSl6_f.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="309" />
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s made of magazine pages rolled up in to squares. So I had a look at how to make it and found lots of other things to make with magazine paper which &lt;a href="http://pinterest.com/sarahls12/craft-ideas/" target="_blank">I pinned on Pinterest&lt;/a> (so addictive!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before Jon&amp;rsquo;s family had to leave back to Cardiff we had free cocktails at the &lt;a href="http://www.therutlandhotel.com/bar-rutland-hotel-2.htm" target="_blank">Rutland Hotel Bar&lt;/a> :D They were so good - in order of yummiest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>42 Ways to Leave Your Lover&lt;/strong> &lt;em>- 42 Below Kiwi, Cointreau, mango juice, citrus and basil combine for a long cool thirst quencher.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lemon and Lychee Caipiroska&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>Sharp and tangy with a hint of tropical sweetness, Absolut Citron and lychee juice combine for an exciting twist on a classic.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Crimson Kisses&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>A romantic blend of fresh raspberries, Bombay Sapphire, rose liqueur &amp;amp; sparkling rose wine.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Rutland Mai-Ta&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>Classic Mai-Tai recipe made with our Rutland rum blend, fresh lime and Grand Marnier.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Would definitely go back there for more!
&lt;p>We also had a wander around the shops, and went to &lt;a href="http://www.anthropologie.eu/" target="_blank">Anthropologie&lt;/a> which I&amp;rsquo;d never been to before but Jon&amp;rsquo;s parents had been whilst in the US. It&amp;rsquo;s such a nice shop, pretty expensive, but they had a sale! Jon&amp;rsquo;s Mum found this plate and we had to get it, down to £3 from £12:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/purple-plate.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-554" title="purple plate" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/purple-plate.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="630" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now they&amp;rsquo;ve gone back we are sad they&amp;rsquo;ve gone and we have to get back to studying. Revision plan has kicked back in and my first exam is this Tuesday&amp;hellip; :/ Starting to stress but thing like tea, cake and highlighters make it all a bit better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/uni-work.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-555" title="uni work" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/uni-work.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s my week so far. The rest will be a nice evening tonight then stuck at my desk trying to get all this revision in to my head. I shall be sleeping with symbols in my dreams.&lt;/p>

I really want to find some in the US, and managed to get a big list of ones I can apply for over there – so my weekend will consist of hours of applying to as many as possible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst I was looking I stumbled upon the &lt;a href="http://runrocknroll.competitor.com/" target="_blank">Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series&lt;/a>, a collection of running events across America known for lining routes with live bands, cheerleaders and themed water stations. This year it is being brought over to Europe with events in Edinburgh, Dublin, Madrid and Lisbon. Ooh Edinburgh!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/edin-rocknroll.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-518" title="edin rocknroll" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/edin-rocknroll.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="70" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I went on &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh" target="_blank">Rock ‘n’ Roll Edinburgh&lt;/a> and the 1/2 marathon is on the 15th April. I’m no way fit enough to take part, but they have &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh/volunteer" target="_blank">volunteering opportunities&lt;/a> so I signed up :) It looks like a fun event to be part of so am looking forward to it, you choose what shift you fancy doing with lots of choices of what exactly to do, and they need support from volunteers. And it’s all for &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh/charity" target="_blank">charity&lt;/a> of course!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>To register for the marathon: &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh/register" target="_blank">click here&lt;/a> (by 8/4/12)

It was apparently 20°C today in Edinburgh. I was glad to finally pull out my converse and find some grass to sit on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMG_20120326_172241.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-463 aligncenter" title="myconverse" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMG_20120326_172241-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

I was looking forward to seeing how it compared to the chinese food we have here, and a Friday night eating chinese food sounded perfect! Here&amp;rsquo;s what we had:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kung Pao Chicken&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chinese Pork Ribs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chinese Chicken Curry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And a 'McFlurry' for desert made by Claire ;)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
It was all really good! Will's speciality was the ribs, and they were amazing, the sauce was lovely to dip stuff in after we all devoured the ribs. Was all a lot better than any chinese takeaway I've had in Britain! I took some pics of the food before tucking in, they're not very good quality unfortunately and it's hard to make food like this look good in pics, but believe me it was all so good.
&lt;p> &lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Safe to say we were all stuffed by the end of it, and after some drinks and a few games of 'Fuzzy Duck' we went home and fell straight to sleep! Thank you Will :D&lt;/p>

Hope you&amp;rsquo;ve all had a lovely day :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed spending time doing no uni work at all :). Last week I had a test and 2 projects due in so I was working all day and night for all of that, so I decided this weekend would be a chilled out one! Friday night involved watching 3 hours of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108941/" target="_blank">The Stand&lt;/a>, Saturday was a crafty day and today was a beautiful sunny day so I went to town with my boyfriend for a wander and used my birthday vouchers to get a few goodies!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scrapbooking&lt;/strong>. On Saturday I continued on my scrapbook which is starting to get a lot bigger. I&amp;rsquo;m scrapping my trip to the US that me and my boyfriend took last summer, gives me holiday blues so much. I will blog about my scrapbook more when it&amp;rsquo;s finished. It&amp;rsquo;s my first attempt at making a scrapbook so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to some people&amp;rsquo;s, but I love this way of keeping my memories!  I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get the pages together first and then do the journaling after, so some pages are quite plain at the mo. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peak!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-400 aligncenter" title="Scrapbook Grand Canyon" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2584.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-399 aligncenter" title="Scrapbook Monument Valley" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2584-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">2. &lt;strong>Shopping&lt;/strong>. Today I used up most of my birthday vouchers and had a walk around Edinburgh in the sunshine. I managed to pick up the following, and I'm so excited by it all!&lt;/p>
[gallery link="file" order="DESC" orderby="post_date" exclude="400, 399"]
&lt;p>Look how cute those &lt;a href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/pens-+amp-pencils/panda-highlighters-pack-of-5/invt/00485861/">panda highlighters&lt;/a> are?! I love Paperchase stationery, just wish it was a bit better for the budget. I got that 17 &lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/en/17-Fast-Finish-Nail-Polish_927316/" target="_blank">nail polish&lt;/a> from Boots in &amp;lsquo;Pink Lemonade&amp;rsquo;, will try it out tonight - looks lovely and fresh like summer! Went to The Works too and picked up a canvas for £2.99 - bargain!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then popped into Waterstones to use my book vouchers. I had looked online for some ideas before I went as I know I&amp;rsquo;d be in there for ages trying to decide between them all! Firstly I bought &lt;a href="http://www.sjwatson-books.com/beforeigotosleep/about/" target="_blank">Before I Go to Sleep&lt;/a> by S. J. Watson - &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Memories define us. So what if you lost yours every time you went to sleep?&lt;/em> An original, haunting, and deeply chilling debut.&amp;rdquo; I enjoy reading books like this and this one sounds particularly interesting, the boyfriend fancies having a read of this after me too. Then I bought &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You&lt;/a> by Jojo Moyes - a girly book, don&amp;rsquo;t think the boyfriend will read this one :p. I wanted to also buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pink-Hotel-Anna-Stothard/dp/1846881315" target="_blank">The Pink Hotel&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Into-Darkest-Corner-Elizabeth-Haynes/dp/0956251579/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1332094500&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Into the Darkest Corner&lt;/a>, but they&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been up to this weekend? Enjoying the sun where you are?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[gallery link=&amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; columns=&amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Top: 1 / 2 Bottom: 3 / 4&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;/p>
1.  &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389137/" target="_blank">We Bought a Zoo&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong> I went to see this film this morning thanks to RBS, and I really enjoyed watching it. It was a sad film, as like a lot of family movies, the Mum has died and so it's up to the Dad to look after the kids alone. The daughter Rosie is so cute, and I think Matt Damon makes a great Dad in it. They basically buy a zoo, which I totally would love to do now, and well I'll leave it up to &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389137/" target="_blank">IMDb&lt;/a> to summarise. It's based on a true story too, and think it's great that the real life family still have the zoo.
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1232829/" target="_blank">21 Jump Street&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. I saw this on Tuesday, and as I expected, it was a great comedy that I&amp;rsquo;d recommend. Jonah Hill is so funny in it! It&amp;rsquo;s based on the TV show from the 80s which starred Johnny Depp, although this is comedy unlike the original. Basically 2 guys that went to school together join the police force and end up working undercover in a high school trying to tackle a drugs case. Watch the trailer and go see it!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RLoKtb4c4W0" frameborder="0" width="490" height="279">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Funny Peculiar&lt;/strong>. Me and my boyfriend went to see this in the Festival Theatre last week. We weren&amp;rsquo;t really expecting much as we didn&amp;rsquo;t really know anything about it. We were sat 5 rows from the front, so we were surprised with how good seats we were given for free! It was such a random but funny play, and was weird to see people from TV on stage (incl. Coronation Street&amp;rsquo;s Janice Battersby, Suzanne Shaw, etc). As we walked in there was a sign saying &amp;lsquo;This play contains full nudity,&amp;rsquo; and we weren&amp;rsquo;t expecting that! We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have seen it if the tickets weren&amp;rsquo;t free, as it&amp;rsquo;s not something I would normally do because tickets are so expensive usually for theatre, so glad we got to though!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Baking&lt;/strong>. I baked chocolate cupcakes with chocolate buttercream last weekend and they were yummy! I followed &lt;a href="http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/499762/libbie-s-chocolate-cupcakes" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> recipe for the cupcakes, and it was alot easier than the last ones I made. Hardly any butter in comparison, so a lot less work for my arms trying to mix it all together, and a lot less calories! I used my new Tala measuring cup which I was delighted to be given from George East Housewares last week. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to use, especially when using American recipes which I do a lot of the time, and looks lovely!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve bought some &lt;a href="http://www.philadelphia.co.uk/philadelphia3/page?siteid=philadelphia3-prd&amp;amp;locale=uken1&amp;amp;PagecRef=842&amp;amp;cid=1337&amp;amp;pid=2188" target="_blank">Cadbury Philadelphia&lt;/a> today that I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of making a cheesecake with it tomorrow. Will let you know how that goes, I love Cadbury!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone tried it yet? Or is chocolate cheese a no-go?&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>

We both enjoyed it, and this was probably mostly because of the cast! It&amp;rsquo;s not a movie that takes itself serious and I found it funny (especially the character Trish) and quite a few people in the cinema were laughing really loud that it felt like we were in the States! If you want to see a screening of this, try my post &lt;a title="Free Cinema – This Means War (Multiple Dates)" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/free-cinema-this-means-war-multiple-dates/">here&lt;/a> for free tickets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tonight my friend came over for a movie night with lots of chocolate! We watched &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1204342/" target="_blank">The Muppets&lt;/a> first and enjoyed it especially the songs, you&amp;rsquo;ve gotta love Jason Segel he just makes you smile! Was also looking forward to seeing Neil Patrick Harris in it, but he just appeared for a few seconds (I&amp;rsquo;m a HIMYM fan btw if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell). Then we watched &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596365/" target="_blank">The Woman in Black&lt;/a> and we wished we&amp;rsquo;d watched this before The Muppets! I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it would be that scary because it&amp;rsquo;s only a 12A, but there were a few jumpy moments and I may have screamed twice. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it but maybe not if, like me, you were going to be alone shortly after the movie ends. I have turned on every light in my flat so I won&amp;rsquo;t get creeped out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What movies have you seen recently? I&amp;rsquo;d recommend all of the above :)&lt;/p>

Today is pancake day, so of course I had to make pancakes for breakfast :) Over the weekend I made the Martha Stewart pancakes which I wrote about &lt;a title="Valentine’s Baking and Craft Ideas" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/valentines-baking-and-craft-ideas/">here&lt;/a> and they were more American style and were &lt;em>really&lt;/em> good! I usually make the thin type and generally follow &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/basicpancakeswithsuga_66226">this&lt;/a> recipe, although I only use 1 egg, and I made these today as I think they're quicker to make than American style. Sadly we've run out of nutella but I still had a couple of strawberries with sugar. Although the bag of sugar does seem to have a hole in the bottom as my kitchen floor was covered in it afterwards, oops :/
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-215 aligncenter" title="IMGP2432" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2432-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/p>
I've been spending a bit of my birthday money online and am currently waiting for my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tala-Icing-Bag-Nozzles-Booklet/dp/B002U5C4ZC/ref=sr_1_2?s=kitchen&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1329864909&amp;amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">Tala Icing Bag Set in Tin&lt;/a> so I can start baking cupcakes as I've lost part of my old icing bag set, and this one looks so cute in the tin! I'm also expecting my &lt;a href="http://www.echoparkpaper.com/collections/for-the-record/" target="_blank">Echo Park For the Record&lt;/a> Paper Collection Kit to come soon, so I can continue scrapbooking, love the alphas and elements in this set. So hopefully they'll be here tomorrow!
&lt;p>I also just found out that last Thursday was apparently something called &lt;a href="http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/90408,Poles-gorge-themselves-on-Fat-Thursday" target="_blank">Fat Thursday&lt;/a>, gutted I missed out on that one. It&amp;rsquo;s a Polish tradition, an alternative to pancake day, where they basically eat a lot of doughnuts - I&amp;rsquo;ve marked it on my calender for next year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone celebrate Fat Thursday here? Seems like a good thing to celebrate :p&lt;/p>

Which is why I have taken so long to write a post on here as I&amp;rsquo;ve been so busy, but now I have a bit of time I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a post about it. Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my boyfriend, family and friends for the lovely cards and gifts and for those that could make it out on the night!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a couple of weeks back my boyfriend asked me for some birthday ideas, and I found some jewellery that had been blogged about &lt;a href="http://sweetmondayblog.blogspot.com/">here&lt;/a> that I really wanted. Then when my birthday came and I opened my presents I was surprised to receive these two from him that I love :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly is a necklace from &lt;a href="http://www.wallpaperrose.bigcartel.com/">Wallpaper Rose&lt;/a> which is so cool as it  has a clock inside, and was prettily packaged with a bow. Wallpaper Rose is worth a look, I want more haha!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2333.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-139 aligncenter" title="IMGP2333" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2333-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2336.jpg">&lt;img class="wp-image-137" title="IMGP2336" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2336-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Secondly was this cute little friendship bracelet from &lt;a href="http://lilyloveslola.bigcartel.com/">Lily Loves Lola&lt;/a>. I'd recommend this shop, there are lots of different bracelets all at a good price of just £2.50 each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2339.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138" title="IMGP2339" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2339-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">[hr]&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">The Saturday wasn't just my birthday, it was also 2 of my friends birthdays too. So we all went out to Hive (classy.. :/) but it's so cheap there and we always have a good time! So of course I had to do my nails :) I decided to paint them with Avon mirror shine in bronze, which I've owned for years but hardly worn, and Barry M black crackle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2351.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-140" title="IMGP2351" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2351-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2353.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-141" title="IMGP2353" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2353-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I like the way they turned out and matched my dress. My dress was from &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4212208&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId&amp;amp;searchTerm=SEQUIN|&amp;amp;pageSize=20&amp;amp;fb_source=message#13276692761531&amp;amp;country:undefined^language:undefined^currencySymbol:undefined^preferredUrl:undefined^siteLabel:undefined^langId:undefined^storeId:undefined^salesCatalogId:undefined^viewed:undefined^explicit:undefined" target="_blank">Topshop&lt;/a> and was only £15 in the sale, and although the sequins rubbed my arm a bit, I really liked it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/Dress.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-143" title="Dress" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/Dress-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">So that's my birthday done for a year and next up is Valentine's day, time is flying by! We managed to grab some Titanic 3D tickets for tomorrow and I am so glad I kept checking for them, be persistent and hope for cancellations if you want to see it. Hope you all have a lovely day filled with love and chocolate :)&lt;/p>

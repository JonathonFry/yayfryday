On Friday I heard that the cherry blossom had arrived in the Meadows so I made plans to take a walk to the park on Saturday with camera in hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We walked to the Meadows via Bruntsfield, with a scrummy stop off at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cafegrande.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cafe Grande&lt;/a> for a late breakfast. I had a bacon breakfast roll and Jon went for poached eggs on toast, gobbled down with a cup of tea and a cappuccino.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I recommend a trip to the Meadows for plenty of cherry blossom photo opportunities. Just get there early if it&amp;rsquo;s a sunny day - before the barbecuers descend (or you could join them).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Spring!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weekend was Jon&amp;rsquo;s birthday weekend (hooray!) and we spent our Saturday in East Lothian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started the day at Seacliff beach (they normally have a barrier charging £2 per car for parking but it was broken). The drive from Edinburgh was lovely, passing through fields of rapeseed, and the sandy beach at Seacliff was nice and quiet. There are great views of Bass Rock and Tantallon castle here, somehow this was our first visit (and will not be our last). We went for a walk along the rocks, past the teeny harbour, towards the castle.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Late afternoon we drove to North Berwick. I had pre-bought tickets for the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.seabird.org/boats/three-islands-seabird-seafari/14/159" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Three Islands Seabird Seafari&lt;/a> RIB trip and the weather was perfect for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The highlight for me was the puffins on Craigleith Island. The volume of gannets on Bass Rock was amazing too, and it was a good idea to put the hood from the waterproofs up as there were a lot of birds flying above us! It was so much fun, we want to do the Isle of May trip next.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This time I played with the advanced options in Guide mode. I can see this being a really useful feature to help learn how some of the manual modes work. I also tried out different release modes and zoom.&lt;/p>

>new camera&lt;/a> trip, Jon &amp;amp; I went for a walk around Blackford Hill. I wrote about this place two years ago (&lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2012/09/05/life-lately-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>). It&amp;rsquo;s funny to look at the photos I took up on the hill back then (probably taken on my Orange San Francisco phone!). There are always lots of photographers up there so I knew it would be a good spot to try out the camera.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I still have a very long way to go, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what half of the buttons do. It was fun to just play around with the camera and see what it could do with some of the more simple settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was such a nice evening it was hard not to get some decent photos up on the hill with the great views over Edinburgh. I love how the leaves are beginning to turn brown too.&lt;/p>

>Inchcolm Island&lt;/a>. The boat to Inchcolm leaves from South Queensferry, right under the Forth Bridge. This was my first time here and we will be back to explore more of this area (I have heard it&amp;rsquo;s a great spot for sunsets too).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We had around 2 hours to spend on Inchcolm. We had a picnic, wandered around the abbey and ran away from the dive-bombing seagulls. Jon was lucky enough to spot a puffin fly past, and there were lots of seals sunbathing on the rocks. We wished we had longer to explore more of the island, although it was a very hot day so we were glad to get back for an ice-cream!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last weekend my Dad came up to visit us in Edinburgh. Since he&amp;rsquo;s been to Edinburgh a few times we decided to venture out to places just outside of the city. On Saturday we went to Rosslyn Chapel and Sunday we went on a boat to Inchcolm Island (more on that later). It was a really fun weekend!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon and I had stopped by at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.rosslynchapel.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Rosslyn chapel&lt;/a> a few years ago, but we never went inside and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the outside since it was covered in scaffolding and a huge umbrella (which was being used to dry out the chapel&amp;rsquo;s walls and roof). It&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting place, made extra famous by The Da Vinci Code, with a mass of intricate carvings everywhere. The guides also do talks inside the chapel, with lots of interesting stories including the &amp;lsquo;Apprentice Pillar&amp;rsquo; and the crazy theories people have about what lies in the buried vaults (Elvis?!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A very mysterious place and one that I&amp;rsquo;d recommend visiting! (I have no photos of the inside as photography wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed)&lt;/p>

>Roslin Glen Country Park&lt;/a>. It was a very foggy and wet day but we managed to go for a good walk along the river. We passed Rosslyn castle and we were looking for Wallace&amp;rsquo;s cave which after a few detours we managed to find.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a great week of weather the weekend comes along and brings with it the rain. At least we had to spend most of the day waiting in on an IKEA delivery and then 3 hours building a sofabed. At around 8pm we decided it was time to leave the flat despite the downpour. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like summer with this weather but I am so enjoying these long daylight hours.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday, Jon &amp;amp; I headed out for the Pentland hills for some hill walking. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been hill walking in a while, and since we are planning on walking up Ben Nevis by next Summer we thought we should get back into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We parked up at Flotterstone and did the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks Short Route&lt;/a>, a nice 10km/3hrs 30mins loop. I always try and print out the planned route before we go - Bing maps have an Ordnance Survey layer which is great and of course free!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1937" alt="pentlands2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t so great - one minute the sun was shining and the next it was pouring down. It was also super windy on the hills. I was almost blown away! The views were fantastic and we shall have to come back to do the 18km route in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I finally have my first ever pair of hiking boots, yay! No more walking up hills in my Hunter Wellies and having sore toes and heels, although they were great at keeping the mud off me. After lots of searching online I went to McArthurGlen in Livingston and tried on a few pairs of boots I&amp;rsquo;d read good things about. In the end I chose these &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/womens/viper-womens-boot-p5978.aspx" target="_blank">Viper Women&amp;rsquo;s Waterproof Hiking Boots&lt;/a> from Mountain Warehouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me they are super comfortable, the grip is great, and they are leather too which is something I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1891" alt="boots" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Sunday we went for a walk to Cramond Island, which is a tidal island, to test out my boots. Jon wore  boots which were left in our flat by a previous tenant! I don&amp;rsquo;t think his boots are waterproof though, so he has been looking for new ones and saw they actually do a &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/mens/viper-waterproof-boot-p7481.aspx?ism=0&amp;amp;cl=BROWN" target="_blank">men&amp;rsquo;s version&lt;/a> of mine!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily the tide was out so we were able to walk across the causeway. It was seriously windy and we could barely hear each other speak. It was a lovely walk with great views of Edinburgh and the Forth Road Bridge. We walked back along the wet beach, at one point I almost got stuck and luckily my boots were tied tight or they might have come off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1892" alt="cramond" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg" width="490" height="1834" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to going for bigger walks in the future and giving these a proper test.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Saturday Jon and I went for a walk in the Pentland hills with our friends Natalie and Mike. The sun came out and it was almost 10°C so we had to make the most of it! We parked near the ski centre and walked up the steep hill, following the Capital View trail. It was really slippery with ice and mud in places and so we slipped a lot on the way down (Natalie in particular) and once you started sliding it was hard to stop!!

&lt;p>On my birthday, Jon and I headed into town for lunch. I&amp;rsquo;d read great things about Papii on &lt;a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d2212342-Reviews-Papii-Edinburgh_Scotland.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor&lt;/a> and since it&amp;rsquo;s in the top ten places to eat in Edinburgh it had to be tried!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we were not disappointed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon went with the lemon and coriander chicken sub and I had the mezzano, salami and olive melt. Washed down with a flat white coffee and a very merry berry smoothie. All sooo good. And the coffee art is awesome. Birthday lunches are my favourite and Papii made it even better.&lt;/p>

We went when it was free (over St. Andrew&amp;rsquo;s Day weekend) at 9.30 am on Saturday. It was pretty cold up there but luckily there was lots of places to explore indoors too. I really enjoyed it, especially seeing the sparkly crown jewels :) We spent around 2 hours looking around - a nice study break!&lt;/p>

Sorry it&amp;rsquo;s been a while, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing much worth sharing since I&amp;rsquo;ve been back in uni and settling in. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched my degree course from Maths with Finance to just Maths which I am so much happier with, and am now back in the swing of things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s some pics Jon took on his phone - the Samsung Galaxy S2 - of things we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently (minus the cookie pics which came from my camera). I think some of them came out pretty well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Walking around the wooded Corstophine Hill and up the &lt;a href="http://www.corstorphinehill.org.uk/thetower.htm" target="_blank">tower&lt;/a> (which was open as another part of the Open Door Days).&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">When we turned around from that viewpoint above this is what we saw...&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/zebra.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261" title="zebra" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/zebra.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="629" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">..Zebras! Through a large fence is Edinburgh Zoo, which backs on to a path around the hill. We could hear kids shouting from inside the zoo and that's when we noticed that the zebras were right up by the fence near us! Gotta love seeing a herd of zebras whilst walking through the woods.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s our first &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; walk in the Hills and we both really enjoyed it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1214&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;490&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1214" title="allermuir hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326" />&lt;/a> Allermuir Hill (493m)[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got the ski lift going part of the way up which saved our legs a bit of work. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to ride on it before and seeing as &lt;a title="European Heritage Days" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/european-heritage-days/" target="_blank">it was free&lt;/a> it had to be done. Great views at the top of the slopes too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/cvw.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1215" title="capital view walk" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/cvw.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1752" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How cute are those thatched cottages?! The walk passes through the lovely Swanston village, where apparently Robert Louis Stevenson spent his summer days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took us a little over 2 hours to complete the loop, and our legs were aching by the end of it. There were a few steep parts that got our heart pumping. We need to do this more often and would love to do the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks&lt;/a> walk in the future!&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Walked&lt;/em> in the Pentland Hills in the rain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Shopped&lt;/em> in TK Maxx. Jon picked up an outdoorsy coat and I found some glass cups (we only had one left) which we managed to get the price down to 50p per cup!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Watched&lt;/em> 2 free movies at the cinema. Hope Springs and Untouchable - I recommend both, &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/" target="_blank">Untouchable&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Explored&lt;/em> a part of Edinburgh we hadn't been to before. More on that below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Enjoyed&lt;/em> our last week before University begins.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div>[hr]&lt;/div>
The part of Edinburgh we went to was a bit of a spur of the moment thingy. After driving back from TK Maxx, I spotted a sign for the &lt;a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/vc/index.html" target="_blank">Royal Observatory&lt;/a> and thought we should check it out. We drove past the lovely shops in Morningside and through Blackford, past some gorgeous (and huge) houses that we dreamed of living in, and finally up the steep hill to the Observatory.
&lt;p>We parked up and it seemed like we weren&amp;rsquo;t in the city anymore. We were on &lt;a href="http://www.fohb.org/new/index.htm" target="_blank">Blackford Hill&lt;/a> which is a local nature reserve  with fields of grass, crags, a lake and river. So we decided to walk up to the top of hill.  It was such a windy day and at the top I struggled to stand straight! The views from the top were the best I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Edinburgh (a 360° panorama). It was also really quiet, just a few dog walkers and that was it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These photos were taken on my phone so they&amp;rsquo;re pretty bad quality. [Jon&amp;rsquo;s just renewed his phone contract and now has a Samsung Galaxy S2 (woo!) so I can use the camera on that when I don&amp;rsquo;t have my proper camera with me now :D]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1195" title="blackford hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1063" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love finding new places like this. This would be an awesome place to come and watch fireworks or for a picnic in the sun. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised it&amp;rsquo;s not so well known!&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s around 45min drive from Edinburgh and you can either go the coastal way or the city by-pass way (or there&amp;rsquo;s also a bus). Obviously the best is the coastal way which is 10miles less, and takes you all along the coast through little coastal villages - cute! Jon enjoys driving this road too and we totally recommend it. We&amp;rsquo;ve driven along it many times and found lots of nice beaches along the way, in particular the one we returned to today at Gullane.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/gullane.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1138" title="gullane" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/gullane.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1717" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We lazed on the sand, had a picnic, read our books, freezed our toes in the sea, went for a walk, and lazed some more. I am in need of a tan, my skin is so pale! I tried out my free sample of Hawaiian Tropic Sunscreen and it&amp;rsquo;s nice and moisturising and smells really good. I dreamt I was in Hawaii&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

Oh we&amp;rsquo;d love to live somewhere that is sunny all the time&amp;hellip; Today we went for a little drive around Holyrood Park, along Queen&amp;rsquo;s Drive. It&amp;rsquo;s a great one-way road with views across the sea to East Lothian and across Edinburgh itself. There are pull outs along the road and we stopped off at Dunsapie Loch. If you&amp;rsquo;re walking up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat this is probably the best place to park up and walk if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the shortest/easiest route up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/holyrooddrive.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1124" title="holyrooddrive" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/holyrooddrive.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1348" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[BTW my camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t like the sun much]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a walk about, watched the swans and people passing by. We noticed the same cyclist go by us 4 times in a short space of time, and the loop is 3.3miles up and down, go him!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I&amp;rsquo;m home I think I shall make some &lt;a title="Philly with Cadbury Chocolate Cheesecakes" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/philly-with-cadbury-chocolate-cheesecakes/">cadbury philly cheesecakes&lt;/a> (as requested by Jon), watch some TV and think about what to do this week. We are off back to Cardiff next Thursday for 2 weeks - can&amp;rsquo;t wait!!&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go here for a while and the weather today made it an ideal time to go. Plus it&amp;rsquo;s amazingly free of charge, you only have to pay to go in the glasshouses, and there&amp;rsquo;s free parking on the weekends/evenings (or plenty of buses).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We only planned on stopping by for an hour, but ended up staying for longer, although we still only saw around a third of the gardens. We walked through the Chinese Hillside, Rock Garden and Herbaceous Border. There was a wedding reception at the Caledonian Hall opposite the Rock Garden and it looked beautiful, this was probably my favourite garden. There are views of Carlton Hill and Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat here, as well as a waterfall and of course lots of pretty flowers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/rbge.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1117" title="rbge" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/rbge.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1635" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind the Herbaceous Border is a huge beech hedge, we walked through it to these little gardens where fruit and vegetables were growing. There were rows for local primary schools to grow their own too which was cute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It felt like we were somewhere else, it was so peaceful and spacious yet so close to town. I could spend hours wandering around and lazing on the grass. We shall definitely be making future trips here and next time we&amp;rsquo;ll bring a picnic with us, or maybe indulge in an afternoon tea. Even if the weather&amp;rsquo;s bad we could pay to have a wander around the glasshouses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Totally recommend this place if you&amp;rsquo;re in Edinburgh!&lt;/p>

We woke up expecting to be going to the &lt;a href="http://www.tasteofedinburgh.co.uk/" target="_blank">Taste of Edinburgh&lt;/a> festival this evening and we were both really looking forward to it. With top restaurants in Edinburgh (incl The Balmoral, Tigerlily and Cucina) and top chefs (incl Fabulous Baking Brothers, Lloyd Grossman, Jason Atherton), it looked to be a great evening out trying out different meals and watching demonstrations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/tasteofedin.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996" title="tasteofedin" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/tasteofedin.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="153" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately we woke up to heavy rain. Overnight the meadows were flooded and we had a text from taste telling us it was cancelled. Wahh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we had some good, totally unrelated, news through the post. It was a letter from my university, which I thought would be the physical copy of my exam results. Instead it was a letter saying I had won an award for outstanding merit of the year along with a £100 cheque! This cheered me up, my hard work studying paid off, wahoo :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we thought we should celebrate and do something since the festival was cancelled. I was kept updated about taste on twitter. Quite a few of the restaurants had special offers for people with tickets which I thought was generous and nice of them. Then I found that &lt;a href="http://markgreenaway.com/live/home.html" target="_blank">Mark Greenaway&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.angelswithbagpipes.co.uk/" target="_blank">Angels with Bagpipes&lt;/a> set up a last minute free pop-up event at Summer Hall serving up their award-winning dishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So yeh we kinda had to go! We went along with Nat and Mike and after a drink and a walk we arrived at the end of a queue. After around 15mins the queue started moving and we were the second batch of people to get in. It felt strange walking in to what seemed like someone&amp;rsquo;s house and it was packed! It was part of Edinburgh Uni&amp;rsquo;s Vet School, so there were a lot of strange things like coloured bubbling cylinders by the bar and other random stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were quite confused with where we were meant to go with people jammed everywhere and being British we felt we had to be in a queue. After switching queues almost three times and nearly walking in to the kitchen we managed to get some scallops with pea puree which was lovely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After ending up outside at a seating area me and Nat decided to try again inside. This time we were a lot more strategic and managed to get desserts of Eton Mess and 2 mains -  11 hour slow roasted pork belly served with puffed crackling, pomme puree and toffee apple jus and a delicious leg of lamb dish. Delicious!!&lt;/p>
&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012" title="toe" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/toe.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1049" />
&lt;p>It was funny to watch people getting food, we felt a bit like seagulls when it came around. One guy had like 10 plates of scallops all to himself (not in one go mind)! There was so much food - I think I had 4 desserts, 2 mains and a starter. The dessert was definitely my favourite, think Jon liked the pomme puree (or mash to us lot) and pork the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a big thank you to everyone involved, especially to Mark Greenaway and Paul Whitecross for their yummy dishes! It&amp;rsquo;s such a shame about the festival being cancelled because of the rain, but we ended up having a great day after all.&lt;/p>

The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good but we wanted to get some fresh air and exercise after a very lazy weekend (think movies and lots of ice-cream). From our flat to the park it&amp;rsquo;s about 2.5miles through Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s old town. We had planned on walking up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat but the ground was quite slippery so skipped it this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988" title="holyrood" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1062" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead we walked along the Salisbury Crags and up to the base of Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat and around in a loop. There were quite a lot of people about, and a few runners covered in mud. We would like to live near here so we could go jogging around the park in the mornings, perhaps one day we will try and jog there and back from our flat (hmm just maybe).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh, it&amp;rsquo;s nice having such a big park so close to the city centre and with great views of the city. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of walks to do in the park, and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it to anyone visiting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989" title="holyrood2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="343" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully the weather will pick up soon, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe we are already in July.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel like yesterday was the beginning of summer. I&amp;rsquo;m not enjoying spending so much time in the flat, especially as I made some calculations and figured we couldn&amp;rsquo;t spend any money until the end of July (next payday) for us to afford rent over summer. So we shall have to start making money other ways and doing as much free stuff to keep us entertained!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we went to Union Canal in Fountainbridge with some leftover crusts of bread. We were soaked by the time we returned home but it feels good once in a while to get out in the rain and not care about being wet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887" title="feedducks" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="531" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny moment when Jon threw some bread, we heard a thump and a pigeon fly right across us, he accidentally hit the poor thing! We felt like kids feeding the ducks, and think we shall go and feed them each time we have old stale bread instead of throwing it in the bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been doing with all these rainy days?&lt;/p>

So me and Jon spent our time on Saturday at Gullane beach and Sunday at the meadows with friends and barbecues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/barbecues.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-734" title="barbecues" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/barbecues.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="925" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this weather lasts, the sun just seems to put everyone in a happy mood. I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You&lt;/a> and so far loving it, I don&amp;rsquo;t want it to end!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beach at Gullane is nice, and luckily our friends have a car so we could get down there easily. From Edinburgh there is a First bus that does go there and other beaches too - the no. 124 I think. Here&amp;rsquo;s a cute pic of Natalie and Mike at the beach :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2957.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-736" title="gullane beach" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2957.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope y&amp;rsquo;all are enjoying the weather too!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The sun is shining and things are good. I start a new job tomorrow, Jon is busy making business plans and it&amp;rsquo;s his birthday on Thursday. We are going shopping, eating and drinking in Glasgow (we&amp;rsquo;ve both never been before) and staying the night in a fab hotel. I wish birthdays came more often!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday we both volunteered at the &lt;a title="Rock ‘n’ Roll Edinburgh Half Marathon" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/rock-n-roll-edinburgh-half-marathon/">Rock &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; Roll Edinburgh Half Marathon&lt;/a>, which was really fun and it was such a nice sunny day. We were over at Holyrood park all morning and after holding rope for the corral starts we ate hotdogs before the runners started to come through the finish line with the female winner after 1hr 16mins! We were working at the chip retrieval where we clipped the chips off people shoes, yum. Was a great day, maybe some time we&amp;rsquo;ll be running it :p&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards we went to Usher Hall to see &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lwxj1/features/banglive" target="_blank">Bang Goes the Theory Live&lt;/a> (not to be confused with the Big Bang Theory)! We managed to get free tickets and it was pretty good. Lots of kids though and I was sat by a boy who couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop jumping up and down in his seat so I was flinging around lol, that was quite annoying after a while&amp;hellip; Was an entertaining show though for all the family and educational too, and the audience were involved which the kids loved. It was my first time inside Usher Hall and it&amp;rsquo;s a really nice venue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Monday - Wednesday Jon had family up to visit which was lovely. It&amp;rsquo;s so good when we have visitors, sucks we are so far away! They were staying in an amazing apartment right in town with heated floors which were so nice and even a garden. Hate how cold our flat is :( There was this mirror in the lounge which I love:&lt;/p>
&lt;img class="aligncenter" title="mirror" src="http://media-cache2.pinterest.com/upload/26529085275208448_hmRtjSl6_f.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="309" />
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s made of magazine pages rolled up in to squares. So I had a look at how to make it and found lots of other things to make with magazine paper which &lt;a href="http://pinterest.com/sarahls12/craft-ideas/" target="_blank">I pinned on Pinterest&lt;/a> (so addictive!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before Jon&amp;rsquo;s family had to leave back to Cardiff we had free cocktails at the &lt;a href="http://www.therutlandhotel.com/bar-rutland-hotel-2.htm" target="_blank">Rutland Hotel Bar&lt;/a> :D They were so good - in order of yummiest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>42 Ways to Leave Your Lover&lt;/strong> &lt;em>- 42 Below Kiwi, Cointreau, mango juice, citrus and basil combine for a long cool thirst quencher.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lemon and Lychee Caipiroska&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>Sharp and tangy with a hint of tropical sweetness, Absolut Citron and lychee juice combine for an exciting twist on a classic.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Crimson Kisses&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>A romantic blend of fresh raspberries, Bombay Sapphire, rose liqueur &amp;amp; sparkling rose wine.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Rutland Mai-Ta&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>Classic Mai-Tai recipe made with our Rutland rum blend, fresh lime and Grand Marnier.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Would definitely go back there for more!
&lt;p>We also had a wander around the shops, and went to &lt;a href="http://www.anthropologie.eu/" target="_blank">Anthropologie&lt;/a> which I&amp;rsquo;d never been to before but Jon&amp;rsquo;s parents had been whilst in the US. It&amp;rsquo;s such a nice shop, pretty expensive, but they had a sale! Jon&amp;rsquo;s Mum found this plate and we had to get it, down to £3 from £12:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/purple-plate.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-554" title="purple plate" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/purple-plate.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="630" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now they&amp;rsquo;ve gone back we are sad they&amp;rsquo;ve gone and we have to get back to studying. Revision plan has kicked back in and my first exam is this Tuesday&amp;hellip; :/ Starting to stress but thing like tea, cake and highlighters make it all a bit better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/uni-work.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-555" title="uni work" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/uni-work.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s my week so far. The rest will be a nice evening tonight then stuck at my desk trying to get all this revision in to my head. I shall be sleeping with symbols in my dreams.&lt;/p>

I really want to find some in the US, and managed to get a big list of ones I can apply for over there – so my weekend will consist of hours of applying to as many as possible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst I was looking I stumbled upon the &lt;a href="http://runrocknroll.competitor.com/" target="_blank">Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series&lt;/a>, a collection of running events across America known for lining routes with live bands, cheerleaders and themed water stations. This year it is being brought over to Europe with events in Edinburgh, Dublin, Madrid and Lisbon. Ooh Edinburgh!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/edin-rocknroll.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-518" title="edin rocknroll" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/edin-rocknroll.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="70" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I went on &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh" target="_blank">Rock ‘n’ Roll Edinburgh&lt;/a> and the 1/2 marathon is on the 15th April. I’m no way fit enough to take part, but they have &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh/volunteer" target="_blank">volunteering opportunities&lt;/a> so I signed up :) It looks like a fun event to be part of so am looking forward to it, you choose what shift you fancy doing with lots of choices of what exactly to do, and they need support from volunteers. And it’s all for &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh/charity" target="_blank">charity&lt;/a> of course!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>To register for the marathon: &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh/register" target="_blank">click here&lt;/a> (by 8/4/12)

So however you’re taking part, see you there! Hope the weather is nice!&lt;/p>

It was apparently 20°C today in Edinburgh. I was glad to finally pull out my converse and find some grass to sit on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMG_20120326_172241.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-463 aligncenter" title="myconverse" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMG_20120326_172241-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Oh and maybe I'd enjoy some ice cream too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2640-001.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-467" title="icecream" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2640-001-300x292.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="292" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Gotta love days like this, I can't wait for summer to hurry up now. Just hope the sun sticks around a while longer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">How have you been enjoying this lovely weather?&lt;/p>

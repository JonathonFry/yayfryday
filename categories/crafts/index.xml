&lt;p>Hoorah we are married! It was a dream come true to marry Jon surrounded by our family and friends, and we both had such a fun day - it really was the best day ever for us. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some of the details here and a big thank you to everyone for being a part of our special day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some photos of our wedding progress leading up to the day (will share some wedding photos soon)..&lt;/p>

&lt;p>######The Venue
I wrote &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> about choosing our wedding venue, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>House for an Art Lover&lt;/a>. It was perfect for our relaxed wedding, and the team (in particular Robert) were excellent and made sure the day ran smoothly.
We stayed nearby to the venue the night before - Jon with his groomsmen &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/7834217" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> and I stayed with my bridesmaids &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3345932" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. We all went for dinner the night before which was nice for everyone to meet properly before the wedding. Both houses were Airbnbs and were excellent, and great for getting ready in the morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Bride
I chose &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.maggiesottero.com/maggie-sottero/farah/8230" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my dress&lt;/a> last summer, which I wrote about previously &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. I found and tried on the dress in Cardiff (it was on display in the bridal shop window), but I bought it from &lt;a class="link" href="http://emma-roy.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Emma Roy&lt;/a> up here in Edinburgh. I wanted a dress that was quite simple (not big!) and light, and I loved the detailing to the the top and back. My fittings weren&amp;rsquo;t until the month of the wedding, but luckily it didn&amp;rsquo;t need any alterations except the hem and I had a bustle added in so the train could be lifted for dancing.
I skipped a veil and jewellery since the dress had enough detail with sparkles and pearls, and I wore &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.rainbowclub.co.uk/harlow-peep-toe-satin-shoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Rainbow Club&lt;/a> peep toe shoes that I picked up in John Lewis. My hair and make up was done by Lyn Mckenzie and it was exactly what I was looking for - simple and fresh with a pink smokey eye. Lyn also did two bridesmaids and my mum&amp;rsquo;s hair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Groom
Jon wore a suit from &lt;a class="link" href="http://eu.suitsupply.com/en_GB/suits/lazio-blue-plain/P4123.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Suitsupply&lt;/a>. He ordered a couple of different ones online and decided on the navy Lazio which fit great and he looked fantastic on the day. He wore &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dunelondon.com/boycy-punch-hole-and-toe-cap-detail-leather-shoe-0272507490002511/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>tan shoes&lt;/a> from Dune, a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Brown-Contemporary-Belt/40966,en_GB,pd.html?cgid=Mens-Belts-braces&amp;amp;start=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>leather belt&lt;/a> from T.M.Lewin, and a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.asos.com//Asos/Asos-Slim-Tie-In-Pink-Marl-Effect/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=5983749" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>blush pink tie&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.asos.com//ASOS/ASOS-Silk-Pocket-Square-In-White/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=5303730" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>white pocket square&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.asos.com//Asos/Asos-Tie-Bar-In-Slim-Fit/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=4315199" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>slim tie bar&lt;/a> from ASOS. Oh and also some &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Navy-Pink-Large-Spot-Socks/55573,en_GB,pd.html?cgid=Mens-Socks-boxers&amp;amp;start=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>navy and pink polka dot socks&lt;/a> to finish it all off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Decor
Since the venue was so beautifully decorated with lots of detail already we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to do much in terms of decor. The colours we were going with were grey, navy and blush/peaches. So &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.littlebotanica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the flowers&lt;/a> were made up of peach and blush roses with small white tete-a-tete daffodils (Jon &amp;amp; I are both welsh and wanted to incorporate some welsh things - also they smelt amazing), the groomsmen were in navy suits and the bridesmaids in grey dresses. For the tables we had white roses in fishbowls (provided by the venue) and on the long top table we had small vases of white daffodils.
All of the DIY bits were made the week before the wedding. I made the table names using &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/30151035/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>IKEA Tolsby frames&lt;/a> by hanging handmade origami cranes in grey, pink and cream along with the table numbers at the bottom. We framed an &amp;lsquo;order of the day&amp;rsquo; and made an instagram hashtag (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yayfryday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>#yayfryday&lt;/a>) sign in photoshop by adapting our &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2016/02/26/wedding-invites-diy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>wedding invite&lt;/a> design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Guest Book
We had a polaroid guest book, where we used a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/gifts/home-and-kitchen-gifts/photo-albums-scrapbooks/kraft-medium-slip-in-album-4x6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Paperchase photo album&lt;/a> for guests to slip in a polaroid taken on the Fujifilm Instax 210 (borrowed from my work) and write a note on some kraft cards we had set up with sharpies. We also put some &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gingerray.co.uk/bh-721-photo-booth-props-boho.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ginger Ray photobooth props&lt;/a> around the guestbook and another IKEA frame with instructions on what to do. We weren&amp;rsquo;t sure how well the guest book would go down as we read that often people need encouraging to use them - but people were queueing up to add to it which was great! We now have a book full of photos and messages that we can look back on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Food &amp;amp; Drink
The venue included a three course reception meal followed by coffee and tablet, and the food was excellent. We also had lots of wine, fizzy wine and soft drinks as part of our drinks reception and with the speeches/meal. In the evening we had a buffet but most of us were still pretty stuffed from the meal to eat much!
Our &lt;a class="link" href="http://mimisbakehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>cake&lt;/a> was made up of three flavours - red velvet on the bottom, then oreo, and victoria sponge on top - and decorated with buttercream roses on top. The three cakes were bought separately and we purchased a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.windsorcakecraft.co.uk/windsor_three_tier_spiral_stand.html?category_id=275" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>three tier cake stand&lt;/a> to place them on and added a Ginger Ray &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gingerray.co.uk/pp-621-cake-bunting-pastel-perfection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>cake topper&lt;/a>. The cakes were delicious and we saved some money doing it this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Photographer
We chose &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.neilthomasdouglas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Neil&lt;/a> after bookmarking his website a while back. We loved his informal, relaxed and candid style of photography. He was fantastic on the day and we had a lot of comments from people that they thought he was great. We can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see all of the photos - we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few sneak peeks already and they look fab (the photo at the top of this post is one)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Dancing
In the evening we had a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ceilidhminogue.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ceilidh&lt;/a>. It was so much fun, especially since almost all of our guests hadn&amp;rsquo;t been to one before (including myself), and after the first song the band realised we were definite beginners as it was carnage with everyone going in different directions. After that first song they kept things simple but also challenging enough for us, especially as it got later on in to the night! It kept everyone entertained and we were so glad we chose to have a ceilidh. The band did some DJing as well where they took requests which somehow ended up with the majority of the room doing the macarena at one point&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hooray - our wedding invites should have arrived with everyone by now. I wanted them to be quite simple, and I am pleased with how they came out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started by looking online, places like Etsy, and struggled to find anything we loved. Whilst browsing I stumbled on a link to Creative Market and a downloadable photoshop template which looked just what we were looking for (&lt;a class="link" href="https://creativemarket.com/HitchPaperCo/139680-Wedding-Invitation-Template-Suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>). We had them printed with &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.vistaprint.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Vistaprint&lt;/a> on 5x7 premium matte card stock, and went with the free envelopes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/01/DSC_0142.JPG"

alt="wedding invites 1"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The info and RSVP cards are just 5x7 cards cut in half. All the cards have a grey back, and the invite has an ampersand in Abril Fatface font (which I bookmarked a while back as it looks like a J and S). I made a band with kraft paper to hold together the 3 cards and jazzed up the envelopes a bit with washi tape (purchased &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.thefoxandstar.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After finishing my &lt;a title="Breaking Bad Cross Stitch" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/09/10/breaking-bad-cross-stitch/" target="_blank">Breaking Bad cross stitch&lt;/a>, I really wanted to make another one and since I had leftover supplies I dove straight in. (I actually finished this cross stitch during Summer over a couple of days - it&amp;rsquo;s taken me this long to get a hoop to frame it!). I was looking for something simple to sew and after searching pinterest decided on a curly ampersand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/11/ampersand-plan.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2023" alt="ampersand plan" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/11/ampersand-plan.jpg" width="490" height="580" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After drawing out the plan on grid paper I got sewing and couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop till it was finished! Very addictive. I really liked how it came out but was unsure how to frame it. Which brings me to this weekend when I finally decided to go and buy an 8&amp;quot; hoop. I painted it black for contrast (this was actually Jon&amp;rsquo;s idea!) and it can now be displayed, finally&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I start my new full-time job next Tuesday, and whilst I&amp;rsquo;m not working I&amp;rsquo;ve been filling my weekdays with baking, crafting and housework. And watching back to back episodes of Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy (addicted). Last week I decided to give cross stitching a go. It&amp;rsquo;s cheap and time-consuming and I can watch as much TV as possible whilst doing it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t cross stitched since I was 15 but it&amp;rsquo;s super simple to pick up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a browse on Etsy and decided to purchase this &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/125818162/breaking-bad-cross-stitch-pattern" target="_blank">Breaking Bad cross stitch&lt;/a> pattern. Breaking Bad is an awesome TV show from beginning to end (OK we are a couple episodes from the end but we know it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be crazy good) so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be cool to remember it with this cross stitch. Jon gave it a thumbs up too which sealed the deal. I bought all the supplies online and got started on it as soon as it was all delivered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed making it and I&amp;rsquo;ve already begun my next cross stitch project. Think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a new hobby here..&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This was a cushion cover DIY that I made before dinner this evening. Super quick and easy. I had found a couple plain white linen covers that I bought off eBay a while ago and decided to jazz one up a bit with a geometric pattern. It&amp;rsquo;s got hexagons, triangles, circles, squares and probably some more shapes thrown in!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcushionsteps.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1919" alt="bwcushionsteps" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcushionsteps.jpg" width="490" height="550" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I drew out the lines first using a pencil and ruler starting with a cross through the middle. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any measurements and just went with it. The good thing with cushion covers is they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be perfect because when they are filled they&amp;rsquo;ll be all bendy anway and you won&amp;rsquo;t see if the lines are a bit off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sharpie-Rub-a-Dub%C3%82%C2%AE-Laundry-Marker-Black/dp/B00387BTJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1333231606&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Sharpie Laundry Marker&lt;/a> to draw over the lines (and placed cardboard inside the cover so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t transfer to the back), and then drew on the circles using buttons as stencils.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcusion1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1922" alt="bwcushion1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcusion1.jpg" width="490" height="1128" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It reminds me a bit of those ball and stick models from chemistry classes. I like how the pattern came out, and for just a half hour DIY it&amp;rsquo;s great!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since Jon and I &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2011/07/23/road-trip-usa/" target="_blank">went to the US&lt;/a>, and now the scrapbook is done! Here is the complete final book (minus all of the printed out blog pages, oh and I want a date stamp to stamp on dates so you may notice some teeny gaps).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/completescrapbook.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1281" title="completescrapbook" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/completescrapbook.jpg" width="490" height="8929" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Click on the image above and it'll become somewhat clearer &lt;/em>&lt;/p>
I'll post my thoughts on this project soon, as well as supplies used, so look out for that within the next day or two.
&lt;p>For some close-ups/details you can see all of &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/tag/scrapbook/" target="_blank">my scrapbook posts here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Firstly I wanted to show how thick this scrapbook has become. I&amp;rsquo;ve been changing things (like re-making pockets out of thinner paper) to make it a bit thinner as it has struggled to close, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty impressed by how much has fitted into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/thickness.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1149" title="thickness" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/thickness.jpg" width="490" height="613" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve gone back to the beggining of the book to add a couple pages on the planning stages of the trip, just a few pages cut out of the moleskine I was using to plan, some snaps of things like our &amp;lsquo;important items to be packed&amp;rsquo; and a map of our planned route.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/plans.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1150" title="plans" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/plans.jpg" width="490" height="485" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve added journalling to roughly a quarter of the pages so still have a lot more to do with that. I&amp;rsquo;ve realised now that I should&amp;rsquo;ve just printed off the blog posts and stuck those in within the pages, but hey that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt and that&amp;rsquo;s what I would do in the future. For now I shall continue with it, the journalling spots aren&amp;rsquo;t big ones they&amp;rsquo;re just little snippets of what we did on that day so hopefully won&amp;rsquo;t take too much longer to complete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did want to include the&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/category/usa-road-trip/" target="_blank"> blog posts&lt;/a> in the book, so I just put together the pages on Photoshop Elements and printed them on card and stuck them in at the back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/blogprints.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151" title="blogprints" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/blogprints.jpg" width="490" height="588" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are still a few pages at the very back where I&amp;rsquo;ll probably stick in something to hold stuff I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put in the book, and a  DVD of all our photos and our roadtrip playlist. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to finish it up and to move on to my next project&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

I think I only have like 2 more pages to do before I go back and tidy up some of the earlier pages, add a few simple pages to the beginning and ends (I&amp;rsquo;m going to print out the blog posts we wrote whilst on the road and stick them in at the end), then finally get round to journalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the pages I finished today, it looks pretty cluttered but I think looking at the pages as a whole it&amp;rsquo;s not so crazy. Although these couple of days in LA were rather hectic!&lt;/p>

Things slowed down recently as I was doing lots of overtime at work and I felt a couple of photos were missing from my stash to use in the book. But now work has calmed down and my awesome mum gave me an awesome printer so I can get going with it some more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I finished up 3 pages, all of our journey along the Pacific Coast. I cut one of the pages into a semi-circle so all these pages &amp;lsquo;fit in&amp;rsquo; together.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to finish it and start journalling and sharing it with you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today it was (partially) sunny outside and whilst scrapbooking I watched the birds, ate some flapjack that I made last night and drank cups of tea. I love this project!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished San Francisco and I&amp;rsquo;m now on to the coast. Just Los Angeles to go after that. I&amp;rsquo;ve started to go back to the beginning and add some things to my first few pages which were pretty plain as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have many supplies back when I began the scrapbook. It&amp;rsquo;s good to see the progress in how much I&amp;rsquo;ve improved since I started!&lt;/p>

Even more so now I have a mini stapler. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rexel-BAMBI-STPLR-1-5M-STPL/dp/B000SHSK9S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1340039737&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">This Bambi one&lt;/a> to be precise.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting the hang of making my pockets to hold stuff sturdily, again by cutting a page in half. I even painted this one &lt;em>and&lt;/em> cut a rectangle out to show the Alcatraz logo-image-thingy and stuck some acetate film in its place, fancy ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still on San Francisco and have a couple of pages still to do here, then only around 5days of the trip left to go before I will get journalling.&lt;/p>

The edges of the samples are already cut in a zigzag so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d keep it that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/bookmark.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856" title="bookmark" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/bookmark.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="548" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the corners of a book I drew outlines of where to cut the material to get two triangles. Then I simply sewn the two pieces together along the edges to create a pocket. The leather sample is pretty thick and so it was quite hard getting the needle through but I got there in the end!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now I shall be using this bookmark on the book I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading. It&amp;rsquo;s nice and sturdy so it should stay in place fine with no worries of it slipping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have a lovely weekend!&lt;/p>

As I still haven&amp;rsquo;t learnt to drive, I&amp;rsquo;m usually the navigator. Road trips are one of mine and Jon&amp;rsquo;s top favourite things to do, being able to get in a car and drive wherever the road takes us and finding new places to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we first came to Edinburgh we spent a lot of time driving around the coast and planning little day trips. Unfortunately we no longer have a car in Edinburgh, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford it, and it&amp;rsquo;s something we miss a lot to be able to just go for a drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst road tripping in the US, we had &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rand-McNally-Road-Atlas-United/dp/0528003364/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1339592973&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">this great mapbook&lt;/a> in the car with us that I used to get us around. We did consider a GPS/using internet but thought a paper map won&amp;rsquo;t tell us to go the wrong way (that would be my responsibility..) and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about signal and having to spend extra money. The mapbook successfully didn&amp;rsquo;t get us lost whilst out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been looking up ways to display maps as artwork , and I found &lt;a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/375160/map-artwork" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> thanks to Martha Stewart (instructions in the link). This is a perfect way to display a road trip!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/map-frames.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845" title="map-frames" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/map-frames.jpg" width="490" height="306" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I&amp;rsquo;ll do a large map of the West of the US and sew on our road trip and frame it like above :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So yesterday I had a little play with a free map I picked up in San Francisco. I hand sewn on the route that we took of a day we spent sightseeing (&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/day-17-san-fran-sights/" target="_blank">this one&lt;/a>) and put an X where we began and ended - the San Remo Hotel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/sewn-map.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846" title="sewn map" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/sewn-map.jpg" width="490" height="551" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having completed this I&amp;rsquo;m eager to sew the big road trip next. I stuck this San Francisco map in to my scrapbook and I think it looks pretty good!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve made some more progress with my travel scrapbook too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapbook-4.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823" title="scrapbook 4" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapbook-4.jpg" width="490" height="720" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m finally on to &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm" target="_blank">Yosemite NP&lt;/a>, such amazing scenery there we both loved it, a definite must-see if in CA!! I have a lot of pics to fill the next few pages with, and this time I cut one of the pages in half to put the envelope on that holds the leaflets, etc in and it&amp;rsquo;s much sturdier that way (other side shown in the bottom pic painted purple). Wish I did this from the start!&lt;/p>

By following these simple instructions &lt;a href="http://www.wholeliving.com/133668/read-wrap-recycle-make-bows-magazines" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>, I was able to make a bow out of one magazine page.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/hail.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-672" title="hail" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/hail.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="346" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from the bad weather (it&amp;rsquo;s Britain after all) I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying not having to revise anymore and having time to catch up on tv, etc. This currently consists of HIMYM (ah season finale :o), Gossip Girl (another season finale!), Glee (yes I&amp;rsquo;m a fan), Game of Thrones (crazy), and I&amp;rsquo;ve started rewatching The Shield (watch it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also been busy with my scrapbook and managed to complete 3 pages yesterday. Any guesses at to where these photos were taken? ;) My &lt;strong>scrapbook peek #3&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/scrapbook-3.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-673" title="scrapbook 3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/scrapbook-3.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1019" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally I&amp;rsquo;ve put film in my &lt;a title="My New Diana F+ Camera" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/my-new-diana-f-camera/">new camera&lt;/a> and have started snapping away. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get it developed even if they do turn out bad..&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So now I&amp;rsquo;ve got more time on my hands I shall be filling my moleskine up with things I want to do and ideas for the blog. Hopefully things will be getting ticked off a lot more frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and sorry about the amount of brackets used in this post, got a bit carried away!&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;m almost halfway through the trip and I&amp;rsquo;ve loved making it and reminding myself of all the good memories we had there. I&amp;rsquo;ve not done any journalling in it yet as I still don&amp;rsquo;t have an acid free pen, but I think once all the pics and bits are in then I&amp;rsquo;ll go through and fill in all the blanks! It&amp;rsquo;ll be so great to look through in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here&amp;rsquo;s a little peek at a couple of pages I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on recently (sorry about the poor lighting):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2814.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-634" title="usa scrapbook1" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2814.jpg" width="490" height="996" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes that&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a title="Free Fabric Samples" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/free-fabric-samples/" target="_blank">free fabric sample&lt;/a> I got in the last pic there :) If you&amp;rsquo;re interested me and Jon kept a blog whilst on our roadtrip that&amp;rsquo;s over &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/category/usa-road-trip" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have you been on a roadtrip around the US or planning one? I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A little while ago I stumbled upon the blog &lt;a href="http://witandwhistle.com/2012/01/16/diy-stencil-pillow/" target="_blank">Wit &amp;amp; Whistle&lt;/a> when I was looking for crafty ideas. I love cushions and was looking for a way I could customise one myself, and fell in love with this one, such a great idea! I had to make it as luckily the instructions sounded pretty straightforward. Click the link above for the detailed instructions, they&amp;rsquo;re really good!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only problem I had was deciding on what to actually put on the cushion. I wanted quite a long quote that would cover the entire cover, and there were so many I wanted. But I finally decided on &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/22842" target="_blank">this quote&lt;/a> - gotta love Dr Seuss! The supplies I used were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Plain Cushion Cover (Bought mine from H&amp;amp;M &lt;a href="http://www.hm.com/gb/product/83390?article=83390-E#article=83390-A" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Fabric Marker (Purchased from Amazon &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sharpie-Rub-a-Dub%C3%82%C2%AE-Laundry-Marker-Black/dp/B00387BTJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1333231606&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Stencil (Again from Amazon &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Helix-Lettering-Stencil-10mm-H40891/dp/B00290IYS4/ref=sr_1_2?s=officeproduct&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1333231651&amp;amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">here&lt;/a> - I used the 30mm one)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A pencil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some cardboard (for placing inside cover)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/diy-cushion.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-498" title="diy cushion" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/diy-cushion.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1189" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>Then I did a couple of calculations and measurements to work out how many lines to do and words/letters per line. I used tape to make a straight line each time I did a row so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get all wonky. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth using a pencil with the stencil before the pen to make sure the words all fit in, remember the pen is permanent! Then it&amp;rsquo;s just simply using the fabric marker to stencil in the letters and fill them in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2690.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-500" title="IMGP2690" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2690.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="405" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s done :) It did take me quite a while to do but that&amp;rsquo;s because I do usually take a while over things like this, but I enjoy doing it! Really pleased with how it came out - these cushions would make great gifts too!&lt;/p>

Hope you&amp;rsquo;ve all had a lovely day :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed spending time doing no uni work at all :). Last week I had a test and 2 projects due in so I was working all day and night for all of that, so I decided this weekend would be a chilled out one! Friday night involved watching 3 hours of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108941/" target="_blank">The Stand&lt;/a>, Saturday was a crafty day and today was a beautiful sunny day so I went to town with my boyfriend for a wander and used my birthday vouchers to get a few goodies!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scrapbooking&lt;/strong>. On Saturday I continued on my scrapbook which is starting to get a lot bigger. I&amp;rsquo;m scrapping my trip to the US that me and my boyfriend took last summer, gives me holiday blues so much. I will blog about my scrapbook more when it&amp;rsquo;s finished. It&amp;rsquo;s my first attempt at making a scrapbook so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to some people&amp;rsquo;s, but I love this way of keeping my memories!  I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get the pages together first and then do the journaling after, so some pages are quite plain at the mo. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peak!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-400 aligncenter" title="Scrapbook Grand Canyon" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">2. &lt;strong>Shopping&lt;/strong>. Today I used up most of my birthday vouchers and had a walk around Edinburgh in the sunshine. I managed to pick up the following, and I'm so excited by it all!&lt;/p>
[gallery link="file" order="DESC" orderby="post_date" exclude="400, 399"]
&lt;p>Look how cute those &lt;a href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/pens-+amp-pencils/panda-highlighters-pack-of-5/invt/00485861/">panda highlighters&lt;/a> are?! I love Paperchase stationery, just wish it was a bit better for the budget. I got that 17 &lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/en/17-Fast-Finish-Nail-Polish_927316/" target="_blank">nail polish&lt;/a> from Boots in &amp;lsquo;Pink Lemonade&amp;rsquo;, will try it out tonight - looks lovely and fresh like summer! Went to The Works too and picked up a canvas for £2.99 - bargain!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then popped into Waterstones to use my book vouchers. I had looked online for some ideas before I went as I know I&amp;rsquo;d be in there for ages trying to decide between them all! Firstly I bought &lt;a href="http://www.sjwatson-books.com/beforeigotosleep/about/" target="_blank">Before I Go to Sleep&lt;/a> by S. J. Watson - &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Memories define us. So what if you lost yours every time you went to sleep?&lt;/em> An original, haunting, and deeply chilling debut.&amp;rdquo; I enjoy reading books like this and this one sounds particularly interesting, the boyfriend fancies having a read of this after me too. Then I bought &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You&lt;/a> by Jojo Moyes - a girly book, don&amp;rsquo;t think the boyfriend will read this one :p. I wanted to also buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pink-Hotel-Anna-Stothard/dp/1846881315" target="_blank">The Pink Hotel&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Into-Darkest-Corner-Elizabeth-Haynes/dp/0956251579/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1332094500&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Into the Darkest Corner&lt;/a>, but they&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been up to this weekend? Enjoying the sun where you are?&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Today my &lt;a href="http://www.echoparkpaper.com/collections/for-the-record/" target="_blank">Echo Park - For The Record&lt;/a> collection kit came and I'm so excited to use it. I love the patterns and colours, and the cute little scrabble letters and the bird and flower stickers... I could go on. I got the kit for around £15 online and you get a lot for the money. The kit contains 12 sheets of 12x12 paper, alphas and border stickers, and element stickers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I just wish there was more time in the day to do scrapbooking, I get addicted to it once I start but I have uni work to catch up on first. The Wales v England 6 Nations rugby match is also on today so I shall be watching that, and I want to bake cupcakes today too.. better get started!!&lt;/p>

>orange and almond cake recipe&lt;/a>. The recipe starts with boiling some oranges in a pan, which left the kitchen smelling divine, and then blitzing them up whole.&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go back to Switzerland since our Zermatt trip in January 2015 (I wrote about that trip &lt;a class="link" href="https://yayfryday.com/zermatt-switzerland-in-the-fog-snow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://yayfryday.com/zermatt-switzerland-in-the-sun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>), and when cheap flights to Milan came up we thought we&amp;rsquo;d combine seeing Milan with a short trip in to Switzerland. It was a busy weekend, though we were forced to slow down with a 2 hour train delay which ended up being one of my highlights of the trip!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trip began with a late evening flight to Milan Malpensa, where we stayed the night in an airport hotel. The next morning we were up early for our first train journey to get us in to Milan, where we would then travel from Milan to Tirano then another train from Tirano to Pontresina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We bought the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.regione.lombardia.it/wps/portal/istituzionale/HP/DettaglioServizio/servizi-e-informazioni/Cittadini/Muoversi-in-Lombardia/biglietti-e-agevolazioni/Io-viaggio/io-viaggio-ovunque-in-lombardia-biglietti-giornaliero-settimanale/io-viaggio-ovunque-in-lombardia-biglietti-giornaliero-settimanale" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&amp;lsquo;io viaggio ovunque in Lombardia - biglietti&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a> ticket (aka travel anywhere in Lombardy ticket) which covered us for all of our travel, minus the Switzerland leg. At €32.50 for a three day pass it&amp;rsquo;s really good value. We bought it at the train station at the start of our journey (Somma Lombardo). We rode the Milan to Tirano train alongside Lake Como, arriving at lunchtime in Tirano for a quick bite of pizza. Next we were on the Swiss train on the picturesque Bernina line (we rode the regular train rather than Bernina Express so we could get on/off freely). We jumped off at Morteratsch Glacier and walked the well marked trail, which was lined with information points. We continued on the train to Pontresina, checked in to our hotel (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.chesa-mulin.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hotel Garni Chesa Mulin&lt;/a>) before nipping out for dinner. We had raclette in a lovely wooden chalet next to a roaring fire - we were stuffed with cheese and ready for plenty of dreams.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>We stocked up on Swiss chocolate in the morning before our journey back to Milan, via St Moritz and Chiavenna. Starting with a train from Pontresina to St Moritz. The lake in St Moritz was frozen over and after a wander around the town we went for a walk over it, the scenery was gorgeous. We then bought our bus tickets and caught the bus that took us all the way out of Switzerland to Chiavenna in Italy. The bus ride was amazing, winding down mountain road switchbacks and squeezing through tiny village streets.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>When we arrived in Chiavenna we had a bit of time before our next train to Milan, so we went for lunch near the station. But when we went to catch the train it didn&amp;rsquo;t show up, and after frantically running around it turned out our train had been cancelled and the next one was due in two hours (I&amp;rsquo;m sure if we were still in Switzerland this would never happen!). This meant we&amp;rsquo;d lose a couple hours in Milan in the evening, but since it was a lovely day we were sure to make the most of it and headed straight for gelato. We explored Chiavenna, which we soon started to fall for and think it would make a great day trip from Milan. We walked to Parco Paradiso which was beautiful and had great views at the top.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After two hours exploring we were on the train to Milan (via Colico). It was a very busy train with people standing in the aisles, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most enjoyable. We arrived in Milan in the evening, checked in to our &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/15715097" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>AirBnB on Naviglio Darsena&lt;/a>, and popped out for dinner at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.risoelatte.com/eng/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Risoelatte&lt;/a>. It was an interesting restaurant with 60s decor, the food was great and we went with the classic risotto alla milanese finished up with tiramisu.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Our final day was spent exploring Milan. We started the day off by dumping our bags at a bag drop in &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.californiabakery.it/locations/#!san-vittore" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>California Bakery&lt;/a>, and then walked the city taking in as many sights (and as much food) as we could. We visited the duomo di milano, San Bernardino alle Ossa, Sforzesco Castle &amp;amp; Sempione Park, and Basilica di Sant&amp;rsquo;Ambrogio. Fuelled by gelato, obviously.&lt;/p>

It has been months since I last baked something. I think the colder, darker evenings are encouraging me to get back to it and get the oven on. I fancied something with fruit, but also something that Jon would also enjoy so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t eat the whole thing myself right after I made it. Pears were a safe bet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed the Hairy Biker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/pear_frangipane_18911" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pear Frangipane Recipe&lt;/a>. I realised as I was rolling the dough my flan tin is a couple inches smaller in diameter than the one in the recipe, which meant I had to cut off quite a lot of pastry and I could only fit two out of three pears on top. I managed to fit all the frangipane filling in it though (phew), but meant I also had to cook it for longer as it&amp;rsquo;s super thick.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I think the dark chocolate on top really finishes it off nicely. It isn&amp;rsquo;t too sweet either which I like, and eaten warm with some vanilla ice-cream is divine.&lt;/p>

At just under four hours drive from Edinburgh, the Silver Sands of Morar on Scotland&amp;rsquo;s east coast can be reached.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We camped for two nights at &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sunnysidetouringsite.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Sunnyside Croft&lt;/a> which has direct access to a lovely beach with gorgeous sunset views. We walked a long stretch of the coast, ending just past Camusdarach Beach. There were lots of small sandy coves and most beaches we had to ourselves. We had dinner in a pub in Arisaig and ate ice creams whenever we had the chance. It somehow reached 26C whilst we were there in May. It did not feel like we we were still in Scotland!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon &amp;amp; I booked a stay at a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1866736" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>converted mill&lt;/a>, a gorgeous airbnb that the listing didn&amp;rsquo;t do justice. We felt very lucky to stay in such a wonderful place with views overlooking the loch.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We arrived at Loch Tay about an hour before sun set, after a lovely drive from Edinburgh through the Trossachs. Since it was such a nice day we decided to detour last minute up the road toward Ben Lawers. We parked the car before the road got too icy and made it on foot to reach the Ben Lawers Dam. It was very cold and windy, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t take too long before we were on our way back to warm up in the car. The sun was setting and the sky was turning pink. Plenty of sheep on the road made us take a slow journey down the mountain and it gave us plenty of time to take in the sunset.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By the time we reached the bottom it had turned dark and the search for the mill where we were spending the night began. After plenty of back and forths we found the house and after exploring all the rooms and being surprised at how much bigger it was than the photos, we lit the fire and pulled the blankets out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The sun was out again on Saturday which meant after breakfast I soon had itchy feet and wanted to go out to explore. We drove out along the loch and round to the crannog centre for some great views. The short walk up to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/perthshire/falls-of-acharn.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Falls of Acharn&lt;/a> was lovely and the waterfalls were flowing fast. For lunch we stopped off at the Habitat Cafe in Aberfeldy for some delicious soup and hot drinks, just what I needed after a cold walk. We carried on back towards the mill, making a stop at Castle Menzies and another short walk through &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/perthshire/weem-wood.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Weem Wood to St David’s Well&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By the time we were back in the car the Wales v England rugby had started, so we hurried back to drop the car off and then walked along the road to the pub at the Ben Lawers Hotel. They were playing the rugby in a small room which looked like it was someone’s living room with three big sofas. We were later joined by a family from Newcastle, but thankfully a couple of them were also Welsh supporters! After some drinks and a defeat, we walked back to the mill for another night sat in front of the fire.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My birthday began with strawberry pancakes and Jon walking in with a birthday cake lit with matchsticks (after forgetting the candles!). We spent some time on the balcony watching the clouds lift and the sun peak out over the mountains. Soon we were back on the road in the direction of Edinburgh, but we were lucky again with the weather so had to make a stop to squeeze in another walk before we went back. We walked the Kiltyrie Hidden History Trail which was a great loop, but it was quite open and the wind was very cold so we had to keep moving. We made sure to climb on to a boulder for some jump photos though. Back in the car for the rest of the journey home after another lovely trip to Loch Tay!&lt;/p>

But that&amp;rsquo;s where we ended up going, and it turns out there&amp;rsquo;s much more to this Balearic Island than partying - with beautiful sunsets, turquoise bays, and an old town with narrow streets that you can get lost in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stayed in a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sunsetvillaibiza.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>6 bedroom villa&lt;/a> in Cala Salada. The villa was only a 15 minute walk to Cala Saladeta, a stunning beach that we had to ourselves if we were up early enough! We also hired a car which made getting about super easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are my highlights from our family trip to Ibiza.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Early morning walks to Cala Saladeta, having the beach to ourselves and watching the sun rise up over the hills. Beach hopping to Cala Comte and Cala d&amp;rsquo;Hort. A bit of off road driving and a walk to the Es Vedrà viewpoint. Those views. Watching a thunderstorm over the Mediterranean Sea. Swimming in the pool every day.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wandering amongst the cobbled streets and through the walls in Ibiza Old Town, Dalt Vila. Fresh lemonade with honey. Snorkelling. Listening to music and eating ice-cream at the Hippy Market.

Jon &amp;amp; I agreed that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave Scotland before we visited, and so we finally made it there this year. We drove up on Jon&amp;rsquo;s birthday (May 24th), which we hoped would be the best time of year in terms of weather and midges. Turned out we were extremely lucky with both - sunshine, 20 something degrees and zero midge bites. Definitely not typical of a Scottish holiday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We spent three glorious days exploring Skye. Here are my highlights of the trip.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reflections of Eilean Donan Castle on the way to Skye. Walks with stunning and diverse scenery including the Fairy Pools, Coral Beach, Old Man of Storr, and the Quiraing. Checking off a munro by hiking up Bruach na Frithe. The moment the clouds finally cleared for the final stretch and I had that on top of the world feeling.&lt;/p>

Having a nap in the car during a rain shower then waking up and seeing the Isle of Skye Brewery opposite. Dinner at Edinbane Inn. The ferry back from Armadale to Mallaig and an epic drive home.&lt;/p>

On Friday I heard that the cherry blossom had arrived in the Meadows so I made plans to take a walk to the park on Saturday with camera in hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We walked to the Meadows via Bruntsfield, with a scrummy stop off at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cafegrande.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve just ordered another album that I&amp;rsquo;m currently waiting on, a small soft cover album of our honeymoon. Next step is to get at least one framed print from our wedding in our home. Hopefully it won&amp;rsquo;t take me another year to do.&lt;/p>

>five day trip to Barcelona&lt;/a> we stayed four nights in two wonderful hotels. Since it was a special trip for us (our first wedding anniversary), we wanted to stay somewhere memorable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Staying in two hotels was partly due to the fact that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t availability in one of the hotels the whole time we were in Barcelona, so we thought we&amp;rsquo;d make the most of it and discover two areas of the city. We&amp;rsquo;ve also done this before to see the &amp;rsquo;tourist&amp;rsquo; areas but also see the more local side of a city.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Three nights were spent in the delicious &lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.hotelpraktikbakery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hotel Praktik Bakery&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. The hotel is a bakery hotel (a hotel and bakery combined), that had me hooked as soon as I stumbled on it on TripAdvisor. It was an obvious choice to stay here, a unique concept and the bedrooms were beautiful and simple. The location (L&amp;rsquo;Eixample) was ideal for us to visit the Gaudi sights as well as all the other spots in the centre of the city.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.hotelbrummell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hotel Brummell&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> was our final destination for the last night of our trip, and we thought we&amp;rsquo;d end it on a high and stay on the top floor. I was attracted to this hotel because it was highly rated, has cool interior design and looked like a nice local area (El Poble-sec). There are lots of walks and parks in the area, as well as tasty restaurants and bars. It&amp;rsquo;s right near the port cable car and the Montjuïc castle is up the hill.&lt;/p>

The sunshine won in the end and we spent five wonderful days in sunny Barcelona.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In High School I did a project in Art class where I chose to focus on architecture. That&amp;rsquo;s where I remember discovering Antoni Gaudí, and his wonderfully distinctive style. I saw pictures of the colouful Park Guell and many of the buildings scattered around Barcelona, and I was inspired. Fast forward twelve years later and there I am - stood beneath the Sagrada Familia in awe.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon &amp;amp; I spent our anniversary wandering the streets of Barcelona, eating ice-cream in the Ciutadella Park, watching surfers at the beach, and going out for a romantic dinner in a Gaudi built restaurant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our five day trip went something like this:&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why we had never though of visiting Mallorca before, but I am so glad we did. We stayed with my family at the dreamy &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/4542621?sug=51" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are my highlights of our trip (besides relaxing by the pool and barbecues at the villa) in chronological order, with a bunch of photos too:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Port de Pollença&lt;/strong> - A lovely drive along the coast from Alcudia beach alongside cyclists, windsurfers and kitesurfers.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mirador Es Colomer&lt;/strong> - Spectacular views of the coast and the Tramuntana mountains, with dramatic cliffs and the ocean that stretches out as far as the eye can see. There is a car park which can get very busy but quick turnaround of cars means you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to wait long for a space. There is a small cafe too.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Playa de Formentor&lt;/strong> - A gorgeous narrow beach with mountain views and a backdrop of pine trees. Clear waters and a great spot for a dip in the sea to break up the drive on the way to Cap Formentor. We visited in the evening and it was pretty quiet. There are sun loungers you can hire or free gaps to set yourself up on the beach.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cap Formentor&lt;/strong> - Watching the sunset here at the northernmost tip of Mallorca is incredible. There is parking at the lighthouse but people ended up just parking in the road as it filled up. The drive is quite thrilling too and part of the experience - watch out for goats!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cuevas del Drach&lt;/strong> - There are lots of caves in Mallorca and we visited the well known &amp;ldquo;Dragon Caves&amp;rdquo; on the East of the island. The caves are extensive and the walk ends at a large underground lake with a small classical concert. Just be sure to hold back when entering to avoid the crowds (it gets super busy).&lt;/p>

loading="lazy"
alt="Cuevas del Drach"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>S&amp;rsquo;Amarador&lt;/strong> - This gorgeous unspoilt white sand beach is tucked away in the wild Mondrago Natural Park. There are lots of walks you can take from here and there is a beach shack selling food and amazing fresh cocktails (the mojito was excellent). There is paid parking and you should avoid using google maps to get here (you reach a road sign that says &amp;lsquo;GPS IS WRONG&amp;rsquo; and need to turn back) - instead follow the clear brown signs for S&amp;rsquo;Amarador.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cala d&amp;rsquo;Or&lt;/strong> - This resort is near to Mondrago park and we stopped at the marina here for dinner. There are plenty of restaurants and bars to chose from, and a nice place to wander around the big yachts. We ate at Aquarius looking out on to the marina. The food was good and prices decent, but the service wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Valldemossa&lt;/strong> - A wonderfully picturesque village in the mountains. We wandered amongst the cobbled streets filled with plants and bunting, taking lots of photographs as every street was so photo-worthy. This was a definite highlight of the trip for me. Lots of great places for lunch and ice-cream here too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Deià&lt;/strong> - This village is just a 10 minute drive away from Valldemossa. There are fantastic mountain backdrops as you look across to the village, with more cobbled streets and pretty bunting in the centre.&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ll drink it occasionally if we have some made up or if we&amp;rsquo;re in a coffee shop, but generally I&amp;rsquo;d make a green tea if I&amp;rsquo;m having a hot drink. To be honest it&amp;rsquo;s probably because of my laziness as I find green tea the easiest and quickest to make. But I do love a good coffee cake, especially the coffee flavoured buttercream icing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a craving for that coffee icing and so after I rummaged through the cupboards I decided to get baking. A quick google search landed me with Nigella&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nigella.com/recipes/coffee-and-walnut-layer-cake" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Coffee and Walnut Layer Cake&lt;/a> recipe that I used as a base. I made some amendments to Nigella&amp;rsquo;s recipe based on the ingredients I had (eg replaced butter with coconut oil) and also chose to make cupcakes, simply because I find them easier to make and to eat (plus they are faster to bake ;)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/09/DSC03860.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sponge was delicious and the icing was just what I was looking for - great flavours with a good amount of coffee. I froze half of them and took some out of the freezer to defrost a few weeks later and they were just as good, the nuts still crunchy and the sponge still moist.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coffee and Walnut Cupcakes (makes 18):&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Sponge:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>50g walnut pieces&lt;/li>
&lt;li>225g caster sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>225g coconut oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g plain flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4tsp instant espresso powder (I used Illy Classic Roast Ground Coffee)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2.5tsp baking powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>0.5tsp bicarbonate of soda&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 large eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1-2tbsp milk&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Buttercream Frosting:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>230g icing sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>115g soft unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5tsp instant espresso powder (dissolved in 2/3tbsp boiling water)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>walnut pieces to decorate&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Method:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 170°C and line a cupcake tray with 18 cupcake cases. I had to bake these in two batches as I only have one tray.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a food processor blitz together the walnut pieces and sugar to a powder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the butter, flour, espresso powder, baking powder, bicarb and eggs and process to a smooth batter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the milk and combine to loosen the cake mixture. It should be a soft dropping consistency, so add more milk if needed. (If you are making this by hand, bash the nuts to a powder with a rolling pin and mix with the dry ingredients; then cream the butter and sugar together, and beat in some dry ingredients and eggs alternately and, finally, the milk.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divide the mixture between the cupcake cases and bake in the oven for around 18 minutes, or until the sponge has risen and feels springy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool the cupcakes on a wire rack, and once cool you can make the buttercream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a food processor (or by hand using a wooden spoon), mix the icing sugar with the butter to make a smooth icing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dissolve the instant expresso powder in the boiling water and add it to the processor and blend.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spread the icing on top of the cupcakes and top with the walnut pieces.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Our final day in Copenhagen began with more Danish pastries. We walked round the corner from our AirBnB and down a small alley to a Laura&amp;rsquo;s Bakery - yum! We sat outside enjoying our last Danish breakfast, chatting about what we could do today (our feet were still tired from yesterday so we didn&amp;rsquo;t want too much walking).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We decided on a visit to Nørrebro since we were recommended it as a different atmosphere to where we were staying, particularly Ravensborggade compared to Værnedamsvej. We hopped on a bus there (saving our feet). We wandered around the area - it has a more multi-cultural feel compared to Vesterbro, with a variety of shops. I think the area is also known for its nightlife.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13243735_10154257170189216_2588355455464754961_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We walked along Ravensborggade which was filled with antique shops with shopkeepers sitting out in the street in the sun. It was around midday and as we passed some nice cafes I thought we could get away with an early lunch. We ate Smørrebrød (open sandwiches) outside at &lt;a class="link" href="http://gavlen.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cafe Gavlen&lt;/a>. Very tasty and filling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13308222_10154080808841399_8139281782870459394_o.jpg"

alt="Smorrebrod"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back on a bus to our AirBnB we packed up our stuff and dropped our bags into a locker in Copenhagen central station. With no plans we walked towards the shops, passing by City Hall (Københavns Rådhus) where there were a load of plant pots placed on the floor. We rested our feet at a Joe &amp;amp; The Juice (they are everywhere here!) and eyed up an Italian restaurant opposite that we thought would be great for dinner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13243907_10154080936331399_2991638085502378453_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We fancied a hotdog at a hotdog stand but thought we&amp;rsquo;d need cash so I tried to withdraw some but kept getting declined and thought my card might&amp;rsquo;ve been blocked. (I use the Halifax Clarity card when travelling and try to avoid cash.) Thinking we&amp;rsquo;d be without money the rest of the day, we walked to Rosenborg castle which was close by. The renaissance architecture was gorgeous and was set in lovely grounds. We didn&amp;rsquo;t go inside just wandered around outside and found a spot for a short nap. As I woke up there were two swans walking straight towards us. Thinking they were about to attack we jumped up, they had no fear of us and sat right where we were sitting!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After an hour we crossed over to the Botanical Gardens for more relaxing in lovely surroundings. There were red squirrels running up and down trees together. One stopped right by my feet as Jon was snapping photos of them. By the glasshouses there was an ice-cream van and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try my card and hope for the best. Thankfully it worked and so we both went for chocolate and nougat ice creams - delicious - though the cost was crazy at £4 each!!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were told the gardens would be closing soon so we made our way out and back toward the Italian restaurant we found earlier. We passed the organic hotdog stand (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.xn--dp-lka.dk/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>DØP&lt;/a> - we heard about it before our trip) and noticed they accepted card so we felt we had to get one after our disappointment earlier. We shared a regular hotdog and it was so good! Something we noticed about Copenhagen is everywhere we went accepted card - all of the street food stalls/markets we visited did and they also offered some kind of phone payment too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13246267_10154080809946399_2521536337749584355_o.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Hotdog at DØP Copenhagen"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I called our shared hotdog a &amp;lsquo;starter&amp;rsquo; so I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel bad about going straight to the Italian restaurant. The restaurant was called &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.italiano.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ristorante Italiano&lt;/a>, and has been there since 1952 (apparently the first Italian in Copenhagen). We sat outside where there were blankets and heaters, though it was still sunny and warm when we were there. We both ate pizza and Jon had his last Danish beer of the trip.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13247677_10154257171514216_4177888260126791177_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feeling like we&amp;rsquo;d eaten all we could during our time here, we walked for our last time through this wonderful city to central station for our train to the airport. We had a fantastic 72 hours in Copenhagen, Jon said it was his favourite city break so far and it was up there for me too. The public transport was easy and the people were lovely and friendly. The prices weren&amp;rsquo;t as high as we thought they could be (depends where you go like any city), though we noticed desserts were ridiculous - in restaurants they were the same price as the mains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13235539_10154257171684216_1402750838450853989_o.jpg"

&lt;p>After a little lie in and still feeling full from last night&amp;rsquo;s meal, we shared a leftover danish pastry that we brought back from Laura&amp;rsquo;s Bakery yesterday to start us off for the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sun was shining and the forecast showed it would be warm all day so we planned to be outside till late. We walked through Frederiksberg to the Forum metro (we wanted to try the underground), and hopped off near Nyhavn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13308529_10154080941681399_4301066985715590192_o.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Forum Copenhagen"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nyhavn was just like the postcard photos, beautiful brightly painted buildings and busy cafes along the harbour. We walked a slow loop around the harbour. The Copenhagen marathon was on too so it was very busy but there was a great buzz around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13301274_10154257166269216_4811036322036796686_o.jpg"

loading="lazy"
alt="Nyhavn harbour"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started to get thirsty but thought it would be cheaper to avoid the expensive places on Nyhavn so we headed toward the &lt;a class="link" href="http://designmuseum.dk/en/information/cafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Designmuseum cafe&lt;/a>. We passed Amalienborg by chance, and were lucky enough to be there just as they were doing the changing of the guard. The Designmuseum cafe was a much needed break - a slice of chocolate cake and lots of water - and we sat outside in the gorgeous courtyard in the sun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13268396_10154080808191399_6326058895869466461_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrying on northwards our next stop was Kastellet. We had a sit on the grass by the water whilst watching the marathon runners go past. We walked through the star-shaped military fortress. The buildings were painted red which looked great against the blue sky and we stumbled upon the windmill which was cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13243934_10154080808541399_7826212685785392186_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we were so close to &amp;lsquo;The Mermaid&amp;rsquo; we wandered over on the way back. It was as expected, with lots of tourists. Next up was Christianshavn - in particular the &lt;a class="link" href="http://copenhagenstreetfood.dk/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Copenhagen Street Food market on Papirøen&lt;/a> (this was one of the first places I found when researching Copenhagen). We looked to jump on a boat bus across but it was a 40 minute wait so we walked most of the way with a one stop hop on the metro.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13247810_10154257168239216_2585725961717198208_o.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Christianshavn"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a LOT of choice at the market and we must have walked 5 laps before deciding on Korean food (bibimbap), followed by nutella cheesecake and vitamin boost juice. All very tasty! The prices were pretty high though, I think I slightly preferred the meatpackers market yesterday. We did get to eat the cheesecake sitting on the edge with our feet dangling over the water, watching the boats pass for around an hour. There was also a duck fight on the water which people tried to split up - they were vicious!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13305236_10154257168284216_4038922425327395377_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feeling rested and full, we were ready to move again and we wandered in to Christiana (aka Freetown Christiana). It was an interesting place to explore, with DIY houses and an interesting mix of people. Christiana is described as a large commune which is regulated by a special &amp;lsquo;Christiana Law&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13247696_10154080942176399_3022751071551111425_o.jpg"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was now late afternoon and so we decided it was time to catch a bus to &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tivoligardens.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tivoli&lt;/a>. I was super excited about this part of the trip as I love rides and had heard this was a must-do when in Copenhagen. The tickets were quite pricey (we went with the unlimited rides ones), but I think it was definitely worth it. The first thing we did was find the nearest grassy area and had an hour long nap! We needed an energy boost before going on the rides ;). One of my favourite rides was &amp;lsquo;The Roller Coaster&amp;rsquo; - one of the oldest running wooden roller coasters in the world. We went on the Star Flyer at sunset, which had spectacular views swinging round from 80 metres in the air! We ate burgers for dinner and went on all of the rides multiple times (no queues!). We stayed for the light show, which I think is run every night, it was a great end to a fantastic day.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tomorrow was our last day, but since our flight wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the evening we had a full final day of exploring to do (and of course more eating).&lt;/p>

The flights were under £50pp return, and took less than 2 hours (enough time for a couple of podcasts).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We arrived around 10pm and bought a 72 hour city pass, which came in really handy, and used this to get the train to Copenhagen central station. After a short walk, passing lots of restaurants and bars filled with people sitting outside, we arrived at our &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3575856" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Airbnb in Vesterbro&lt;/a>, just off the pretty &amp;lsquo;small Paris&amp;rsquo; Værnedamsvej. The apartment was lovely and our host gave us some great recommendations. We crashed out not long after, looking forward to waking up here and dreaming of breakfast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Saturday // Day 1&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started the day at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.granola.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Granola&lt;/a>. It was at the end of the street we were staying at, and I&amp;rsquo;d read about it online and in the lonely planet guide so it seemed a good first spot for breakfast. It was pretty early and already very busy; we had seats at the bar with a view in to the kitchen. I went for Skyr with honey and granola and Jon chose scrambled eggs with rye bread. Since it was so busy we had a very long wait (even for our coffees), and when the food did arrive Jon was missing his bread and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t till we&amp;rsquo;d finished eating that they brought it out. The food was great but unfortunately the service not so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2016/06/13301316_10154257164189216_4585914634068669373_o.jpg"

&lt;p>After feeling fuelled up, we popped in to a couple of shops and took a stroll along the three lakes in to town. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to buy a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.fjallraven.co.uk/equipment/kanken" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fjällräven Kånken&lt;/a> for a while, and planned a stop in to the flagship Copenhagen store for our trip. I came out with two rucksacks - the Kånken and also the High Coast 24 daypack (for light hikes). Jon encouraged me to get the second ;).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We were right by Trovehallerne and made a stop to wander around the stalls. Everything looked so tasty. We went for a coffee at &lt;a class="link" href="http://coffeecollective.dk/the-coffee-collective-bars/torvehallerne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Coffee Collective&lt;/a> and our first danish pastries (three Snegls - so good!) at &lt;a class="link" href="http://laurasbakery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Laura&amp;rsquo;s Bakery&lt;/a>. Wow Danish words are so difficult to pronounce!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With a caffeine buzz we carried on walking in to the centre towards Rundetaarn (the round tower). We paid around £5 for entry, and made the spiral ascent (no steps!) to the top for the views. On our way back down they were getting ready to close as there was a unicycle race to the top starting soon after. We wandered in to a few shops (Weekday, Tiger, etc) and jumped on a bus to the Meatpacking District.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was around 4ish and we were getting hungry. The sun was shining and there was a great buzz in the market (&lt;a class="link" href="http://koedbyensmadogmarked.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Kødbyens Mad &amp;amp; Marked&lt;/a>). We bought some drinks, Belgian fries and Vietnamese spring rolls from the stalls and sat on the benches listening to music and people watching. Our Airbnb host recommended this market and we were so glad we went.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A short walk back to our apartment and we ended up napping for an hour or so, before freshening up and catching a bus out to &lt;a class="link" href="http://hostvakst.dk/host/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Höst&lt;/a> for dinner. We made a reservation a few weeks ago and we were super excited to try new Nordic cuisine. We decided to treat ourselves to &amp;lsquo;An Evening at Höst&amp;rsquo;, which came with wine pairings and lots of surprise dishes in between courses. The food was incredible and the atmosphere was beautiful. We caught a bus back to our apartment and slept very well!&lt;/p>

I was given Madeleine Shaw&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Get-Glow-Delicious-Recipes-Nourish/dp/140915744X/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Get The Glow&lt;/a> book for Christmas, where she talks about ditching sugar completely and the health benefits in doing so. We saw it as a good challenge which would also be good for our health. The day we decided to do it we checked the food we had and made sure none of it contained added sugar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as difficult as I thought it would be to cut out. Green tea with lemon and Nakd bars kept any cravings away, and it felt good to not have sugar crashes. Plus both of us were doing it so we could encourage each other and make sure we didn&amp;rsquo;t slip up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After our wedding we&amp;rsquo;ve been eating sugar (lots of wedding cake and champagne started it off), though we don&amp;rsquo;t drink squash or eat cereal anymore and still snack on Nakd bars. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will completely cut out sugar again right now, I will aim to cut it out the majority of the time and save it for special occasions only (eg birthday cakes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I baked lemon cupcakes with pistachios as a weekend treat from Get The Glow. They contain honey as a sugar substitute and I chose to use coconut oil as the fat. I followed the recipe but they came out a little dark on top so I think for my oven the temperature could be lowered. The cupcakes are delicious with the zing from the lemon and the crunchy pistachios, and super easy to bake.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Maldives was exactly what we wanted for our honeymoon. Full relaxation on a beautiful tropical island, with blue skies and the clear Indian Ocean. It was even better than I imagined it would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We flew from Glasgow to Male with Emirates, with a short stopover in Dubai. We watched a lot of movies during the flights and the food was pretty good - especially the afternoon tea with scones on our flight home. We booked our honeymoon a &lt;a class="link" href="http://yayfryday.com/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>few months back&lt;/a> with &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.purelymaldives.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Purely Maldives&lt;/a>, who were fantastic the whole way through and offered us the best deal on flights and accommodation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first two nights were spent in a deluxe beach villa at the all-inclusive &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.oblu-helengeli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Oblu by Atmosphere at Helengeli&lt;/a>. It was just a short speedboat ride away from Male which was lovely and refreshing. The island was beautiful, with the added bonus of a house reef so we could snorkel from the shore. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a small island which was nice, and all of the staff were excellent. We ate nutella waffles whilst watching the fishes and rays in the sea, snorkelled alongside a blacktip reef shark, drank cocktails, played outdoor table tennis, ate wedding cake, and said &amp;rsquo;this is incredible&amp;rsquo; a lot.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Oblu we moved to &lt;a class="link" href="https://atmosphere-kanifushi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Atmosphere Kanifushi&lt;/a> for five nights. The island is only accessible by seaplane and it was a great experience (though very hot!) and made the greeting on the island even more special. Champagne was waiting for us at reception and in our sunset beach villa. The island felt very luxurious, and it was quite different to Oblu as it was a fair bit bigger, though it still felt very quiet and secluded. The all inclusive here was fantastic, with a mini bar filled twice a day with food and drinks and a choice of places to eat and activities. The outdoor whirlpool bathtub was perfect to relax in and it was lovely to have a private bit of beach tucked away in front of the villa. We watched the sunset in the sea or on the beach each night, ate lobster, went on a sunset cruise, visited a nearby island dedicated to coral research, had a couples massage, snorkelled with fish including lionfish and unicornfishes, drank mojitos, went sea kayaking, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get over how beautiful these islands are.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hoorah we are married! It was a dream come true to marry Jon surrounded by our family and friends, and we both had such a fun day - it really was the best day ever for us. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some of the details here and a big thank you to everyone for being a part of our special day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some photos of our wedding progress leading up to the day (will share some wedding photos soon)..&lt;/p>

&lt;p>######The Venue
I wrote &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> about choosing our wedding venue, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>House for an Art Lover&lt;/a>. It was perfect for our relaxed wedding, and the team (in particular Robert) were excellent and made sure the day ran smoothly.
We stayed nearby to the venue the night before - Jon with his groomsmen &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/7834217" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> and I stayed with my bridesmaids &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3345932" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. We all went for dinner the night before which was nice for everyone to meet properly before the wedding. Both houses were Airbnbs and were excellent, and great for getting ready in the morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Bride
I chose &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.maggiesottero.com/maggie-sottero/farah/8230" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my dress&lt;/a> last summer, which I wrote about previously &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. I found and tried on the dress in Cardiff (it was on display in the bridal shop window), but I bought it from &lt;a class="link" href="http://emma-roy.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Emma Roy&lt;/a> up here in Edinburgh. I wanted a dress that was quite simple (not big!) and light, and I loved the detailing to the the top and back. My fittings weren&amp;rsquo;t until the month of the wedding, but luckily it didn&amp;rsquo;t need any alterations except the hem and I had a bustle added in so the train could be lifted for dancing.
I skipped a veil and jewellery since the dress had enough detail with sparkles and pearls, and I wore &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.rainbowclub.co.uk/harlow-peep-toe-satin-shoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Rainbow Club&lt;/a> peep toe shoes that I picked up in John Lewis. My hair and make up was done by Lyn Mckenzie and it was exactly what I was looking for - simple and fresh with a pink smokey eye. Lyn also did two bridesmaids and my mum&amp;rsquo;s hair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Groom
Jon wore a suit from &lt;a class="link" href="http://eu.suitsupply.com/en_GB/suits/lazio-blue-plain/P4123.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Suitsupply&lt;/a>. He ordered a couple of different ones online and decided on the navy Lazio which fit great and he looked fantastic on the day. He wore &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dunelondon.com/boycy-punch-hole-and-toe-cap-detail-leather-shoe-0272507490002511/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>tan shoes&lt;/a> from Dune, a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Brown-Contemporary-Belt/40966,en_GB,pd.html?cgid=Mens-Belts-braces&amp;amp;start=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>leather belt&lt;/a> from T.M.Lewin, and a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.asos.com//Asos/Asos-Slim-Tie-In-Pink-Marl-Effect/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=5983749" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>white pocket square&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.asos.com//Asos/Asos-Tie-Bar-In-Slim-Fit/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=4315199" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>slim tie bar&lt;/a> from ASOS. Oh and also some &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Navy-Pink-Large-Spot-Socks/55573,en_GB,pd.html?cgid=Mens-Socks-boxers&amp;amp;start=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>navy and pink polka dot socks&lt;/a> to finish it all off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Decor
Since the venue was so beautifully decorated with lots of detail already we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to do much in terms of decor. The colours we were going with were grey, navy and blush/peaches. So &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.littlebotanica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the flowers&lt;/a> were made up of peach and blush roses with small white tete-a-tete daffodils (Jon &amp;amp; I are both welsh and wanted to incorporate some welsh things - also they smelt amazing), the groomsmen were in navy suits and the bridesmaids in grey dresses. For the tables we had white roses in fishbowls (provided by the venue) and on the long top table we had small vases of white daffodils.
All of the DIY bits were made the week before the wedding. I made the table names using &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/30151035/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>IKEA Tolsby frames&lt;/a> by hanging handmade origami cranes in grey, pink and cream along with the table numbers at the bottom. We framed an &amp;lsquo;order of the day&amp;rsquo; and made an instagram hashtag (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yayfryday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>#yayfryday&lt;/a>) sign in photoshop by adapting our &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2016/02/26/wedding-invites-diy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>wedding invite&lt;/a> design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Guest Book
We had a polaroid guest book, where we used a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/gifts/home-and-kitchen-gifts/photo-albums-scrapbooks/kraft-medium-slip-in-album-4x6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Paperchase photo album&lt;/a> for guests to slip in a polaroid taken on the Fujifilm Instax 210 (borrowed from my work) and write a note on some kraft cards we had set up with sharpies. We also put some &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gingerray.co.uk/bh-721-photo-booth-props-boho.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ginger Ray photobooth props&lt;/a> around the guestbook and another IKEA frame with instructions on what to do. We weren&amp;rsquo;t sure how well the guest book would go down as we read that often people need encouraging to use them - but people were queueing up to add to it which was great! We now have a book full of photos and messages that we can look back on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Food &amp;amp; Drink
The venue included a three course reception meal followed by coffee and tablet, and the food was excellent. We also had lots of wine, fizzy wine and soft drinks as part of our drinks reception and with the speeches/meal. In the evening we had a buffet but most of us were still pretty stuffed from the meal to eat much!
Our &lt;a class="link" href="http://mimisbakehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>cake&lt;/a> was made up of three flavours - red velvet on the bottom, then oreo, and victoria sponge on top - and decorated with buttercream roses on top. The three cakes were bought separately and we purchased a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.windsorcakecraft.co.uk/windsor_three_tier_spiral_stand.html?category_id=275" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>three tier cake stand&lt;/a> to place them on and added a Ginger Ray &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gingerray.co.uk/pp-621-cake-bunting-pastel-perfection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>cake topper&lt;/a>. The cakes were delicious and we saved some money doing it this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Photographer
We chose &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.neilthomasdouglas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Neil&lt;/a> after bookmarking his website a while back. We loved his informal, relaxed and candid style of photography. He was fantastic on the day and we had a lot of comments from people that they thought he was great. We can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see all of the photos - we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few sneak peeks already and they look fab (the photo at the top of this post is one)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>######The Dancing
In the evening we had a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ceilidhminogue.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ceilidh&lt;/a>. It was so much fun, especially since almost all of our guests hadn&amp;rsquo;t been to one before (including myself), and after the first song the band realised we were definite beginners as it was carnage with everyone going in different directions. After that first song they kept things simple but also challenging enough for us, especially as it got later on in to the night! It kept everyone entertained and we were so glad we chose to have a ceilidh. The band did some DJing as well where they took requests which somehow ended up with the majority of the room doing the macarena at one point&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hooray - our wedding invites should have arrived with everyone by now. I wanted them to be quite simple, and I am pleased with how they came out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started by looking online, places like Etsy, and struggled to find anything we loved. Whilst browsing I stumbled on a link to Creative Market and a downloadable photoshop template which looked just what we were looking for (&lt;a class="link" href="https://creativemarket.com/HitchPaperCo/139680-Wedding-Invitation-Template-Suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>). We had them printed with &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.vistaprint.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Vistaprint&lt;/a> on 5x7 premium matte card stock, and went with the free envelopes.&lt;/p>

alt="wedding invites 1"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The info and RSVP cards are just 5x7 cards cut in half. All the cards have a grey back, and the invite has an ampersand in Abril Fatface font (which I bookmarked a while back as it looks like a J and S). I made a band with kraft paper to hold together the 3 cards and jazzed up the envelopes a bit with washi tape (purchased &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.thefoxandstar.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wedding plans are coming along nicely (and slowly), so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a bit here on where I&amp;rsquo;m at currently. We have the venue, the dress, the website and the honeymoon sorted. We also chose our wedding party and picked a colour scheme (navy, peach/blush and grey - the venue has lots of purples too). I won&amp;rsquo;t mention what we still have to do as the list is frighteningly long (I&amp;rsquo;m using Trello to keep me organised), but we have most of the big things sorted so there is less of an urgency for the other bits!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Venue: &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>House for an Art Lover, Glasgow&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2015/10/hfal.JPG"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before anything else we concentrated on the venue. We looked in Scotland and Wales, and in the end decided on House for an Art Lover. The house is beautifully decorated, there are surrounding gardens, there&amp;rsquo;s a different room for each part of the wedding (ceremony, reception and evening), and it came in under our budget. We have visited the house a few times now and each time we discover something new, there are so many little details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dress: Undisclosed (sorry!)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2015/10/IMG_3831-1.JPG"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding the dress was a relief, and it was fun to try on different types of dresses. I looked in Edinburgh and Cardiff, with the help of my mum, sister and friend. I was stuck between 2/3 and chose the one that stayed in my mind the most. It will be delivered to the store in January and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to try it on in my size! The dress above was one the assistant really wanted me to try on - not the one I chose - don&amp;rsquo;t worry I&amp;rsquo;m not giving anything away :P.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Website: &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.frywedding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2015/10/website.png"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We put together a website that holds some key information which we&amp;rsquo;ll also add the RSVP on to once the invites are sent out. It was fun to put together, and we thought it would be a nice way to introduce our wedding party etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Honeymoon: The Maldives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first we found it tough as there were so many options, so one day we went out for lunch and to a coffee shop armed with travel magazines and the macbook. Five days later we booked our honeymoon! At the moment I&amp;rsquo;ve been addicted to watching youtube videos of snorkelling/scuba diving around the island. We are going all inclusive and staying in a beach villa - it looks incredible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just under 5 months to go..!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon and I spent last weekend in London. We stayed just one night at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/united-kingdom/hilton-london-tower-bridge-LONTBHI/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tower Bridge&lt;/a> and travelled by train from Edinburgh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was our first overnight trip to London together and we planned to eat, see some sights and shop. We did all three in 26 hours, and napped on the train journey home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our trip was led by food with the sightseeing and shopping in between. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went (or skip to the photos below):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brunch at The Breakfast Club. Prosecco spritzers at Borough Market. A walk along the river to the Millennium Bridge passing The Clink and Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Globe. Walk around Westminster to Covent Garden. Burger and shake at Shake Shack. Shopping. Dinner at Rossopomodoro, Hoxton. SLEEP. Breakfast at Jamie&amp;rsquo;s Italian (it came with the room). Second breakfast at the Sky Pod Bar in the Sky Garden. Walk along the river passing the Tower of London and over Tower Bridge. Window shopping. Pizza at Homeslice in Neal&amp;rsquo;s Yard.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know when we&amp;rsquo;ll have another trip to London, but Jon has a work trip there at the end of October and I may have already asked him to bring me back a couple of things. :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The box is designed to be coloured in, and comes with colouring pencils too so you can get going on it straight away. Here&amp;rsquo;s what came in my box:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>NUDE ProGenius Omega Treatment Oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CAUDALIE Vinoperfect Radiance Tinted Moisturiser in &lt;em>Light&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>LIZ EARLE BEAUTY CO Cleanse &amp;amp; Polish Hot Cloth Cleanser + Muslin Cloth&lt;/li>

&lt;li>JELLY PONG PONG Caribbean Sun Bronzer Duo in &lt;em>Martinique&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>LOLA BARCELONA Nail Polish in &lt;em>Rambla&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NUMBER 4 Lumiere d&amp;rsquo;Hiver Reconstructing Masque&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Colouring Pencils&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>My favourites so far are the Liz Earle cleanser and Caudalie tinted moisturiser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Jon&amp;rsquo;s birthday I bought him the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.birchbox.co.uk/shop/birchbox-man-limited-edition-box" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Birchbox Man Limited Edition Box&lt;/a>. He loves it and it&amp;rsquo;s a shame they don&amp;rsquo;t do more boxes for men. He uses every one of the products in the box, and his favourite is the English Laundry Notting Hill cologne.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weekend was Jon&amp;rsquo;s birthday weekend (hooray!) and we spent our Saturday in East Lothian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started the day at Seacliff beach (they normally have a barrier charging £2 per car for parking but it was broken). The drive from Edinburgh was lovely, passing through fields of rapeseed, and the sandy beach at Seacliff was nice and quiet. There are great views of Bass Rock and Tantallon castle here, somehow this was our first visit (and will not be our last). We went for a walk along the rocks, past the teeny harbour, towards the castle.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Late afternoon we drove to North Berwick. I had pre-bought tickets for the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.seabird.org/boats/three-islands-seabird-seafari/14/159" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Three Islands Seabird Seafari&lt;/a> RIB trip and the weather was perfect for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The highlight for me was the puffins on Craigleith Island. The volume of gannets on Bass Rock was amazing too, and it was a good idea to put the hood from the waterproofs up as there were a lot of birds flying above us! It was so much fun, we want to do the Isle of May trip next.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The alarm went off on Sunday and we jumped to the end of the bed to open the blinds. It was still pretty dark outside but as our eyes adjusted we could make out a white triangle - the Matterhorn!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We packed our bags and headed for the train station lockers. It was amazing to see the mountains that were surrounding the town, it felt so different to the day before. Since the weather was so nice we decided we would take the Gornergrat train up to the top of the mountain. It was so worth it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was -17C at the top but the sun definitely helped. We hiked down from &lt;strong>Rotenboden &amp;gt; Riffelberg&lt;/strong>. This was an interesting hike as it turned out we were on a snowshoe trail (the walking trail was hidden under the snow). We came across another walker who was as confused about the trail as we were and it seemed we were way off track. We were trying to find the Riffelsee lake (which we later discovered was just buried under the snow). It was a fantastic walk regardless (although I did step thigh deep in snow twice, Jon had to help me out!).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At Riffelberg we sat in the sun with a drink and a toblerone (we couldn&amp;rsquo;t help ourselves!), before taking the train back down to Zermatt and catching the train on to Visp and onwards to Basel. (We stocked up on chocolate &amp;amp; fondue before we left too)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few weeks ago Jon &amp;amp; I took a 2-night trip to Zermatt. It was our first trip to Switzerland together and it was beautiful. We flew cheap with Easyjet to Basel and travelled down to Zermatt by train using Swiss transfer tickets. We stayed in a lovely &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/869728" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>airbnb studio apartment&lt;/a> on the river with views of the Matterhorn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two days (Friday &amp;amp; Saturday) were foggy and snowy &amp;amp; visiblity was very poor. On Friday evening we explored the car free village and cooked rösti with gruyere, finished off with swiss chocolate (of course ;)).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We layered up for a full day out hiking, and checked which trails were open. We decided on the loop &lt;strong>Zermatt &amp;gt; Z&amp;rsquo;mutt &amp;gt; Furi &amp;gt; Zum See &amp;gt; Zermatt&lt;/strong> for our first hike with a lunch stop at &lt;a class="link" href="http://chalet-altesse-restaurant-zumsee.ch/en/restaurant-zumsee-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Restaurant Zum See&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hike was a little tiring in parts (especially when the snow was blowing in our faces) but it was good to breathe in the fresh mountain air and do some exploring. A friendly ginger cat lead us from Z&amp;rsquo;mutt almost to Furi (we actually had to run away from it so it would stop walking with us&amp;hellip;). If we stopped walking it would start meowing at us to hurry up! Lunch at Zum See was amazing, I ate croute au fromage with bacon and tomatoes (sooo good) and Jon had rösti with bacon and eggs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the afternoon we hiked &lt;strong>Zermatt &amp;gt; Findeln &amp;gt; Zermatt&lt;/strong>. There were a lot of switchbacks and we had to dodge the tobogganers coming down the trail. It was a lovely walk and we made it back down just before sunset.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I still can&amp;rsquo;t get over this place. We drank champagne in the hot tub under the stars, ate great steaks, relaxed in the sauna, sat by the fire, and watched deer in the fields whilst in the double roll top bath.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon proposed on Saturday morning when the sun was still rising. I was in my pyjamas and wondered why he was wearing a shirt. Though we both knew it would happen soon I was still surprised when it actually happened. We could not stop smiling and spent the rest of the day dancing around. It was better than I could ever have imagined and I am so excited to marry my best friend and become Mrs Fry.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last weekend Jon &amp;amp; I went up north to Loch Tay with 2 of our friends and their black labrador pup. This was our second time staying in Loch Tay (we stayed in a beautiful cottage there for our anniversary last year), it&amp;rsquo;s a lovely location with lots to do in the area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stayed in a 2 bedroom cottage (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3825964" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this one&lt;/a>) which had views over the lake, it&amp;rsquo;s own private beach and a games room with a table tennis table. We played board games, sat by the fire, cooked in the fantastic kitchen and went walking by the lake and up in to the mountains. There was no TV and I had no phone signal, so it was a complete retreat away from screens and it felt so good.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a tin of pumpkin puree in my cupboard for quite some time, knowing that at some point I would bake something with it. Then a copy of olive magazine came through my door. I spotted the pumpkin pie spiced muffins recipe and knew instantly that was what I would bake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are so tasty and the sponge is lovely and moist. The spice isn&amp;rsquo;t too overpowering either (which I was worried about), it&amp;rsquo;s nice and subtle. I only iced 6 of the muffins and I like the non iced ones just as much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still have half a tin of the pumpkin puree left, so I&amp;rsquo;m keeping my eye out for another recipe. Or perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll just have to make these again ;)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pumpkin pie spiced muffins from Olive magazine (Nov 2014). Makes 12.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>300g self-raising flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tsp pumpkin pie spice*&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp baking powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g light muscovado sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>250ml sunflower oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g pumpkin puree&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Frosting:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>125g butter, soft&lt;/li>
&lt;li>50g icing sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a pinch pumpkin pie spice*&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g cream cheese&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Heat the oven to 180C/Fan 160C/gas 4. Line 12 muffin tins with cases. Sift the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and sugar in to a bowl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mix the oil, eggs and pumpkin puree together. Fold this into the dry mixture (don&amp;rsquo;t overmix, a few lumps are fine). Divide the mixture into the muffin cases and bake for 35 minutes or until cooked. Cool the muffins on a wire rack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To make the frosting, beat the butter with the icing sugar and spice, then beat in the cream cheese.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pipe or spread the frosting onto the cooled muffins and sprinkle on a little extra spice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>*&lt;em>Pumpkin pie spice: you can make this by mixing 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg &amp;amp; allspice.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: Stuck to the recipe. The dough was really wet which made it quite hard to knead. They were &amp;lsquo;baked&amp;rsquo; in a frying pan on the hob.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: I eat english muffins quite a lot for breakfast (straight from the freezer to the toaster) so I thought they&amp;rsquo;d be a good choice, plus they&amp;rsquo;re a bit different since they aren&amp;rsquo;t baked in the oven. They taste good and Jon and I ate them for our weekday breakfasts with nutella or toasted with butter. The texture was slightly different to the shop bought muffins, they were more airy which I think was because of the wet dough.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a quiet weekend. I spent almost all of Saturday in my kitchen (with plenty of cups of tea) whilst the rain poured down. I was waiting in for an IKEA delivery, and when it came Jon and I put together a desk that now sits in the back of our kitchen. Then I did some baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tarte au citron is something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try to bake. I love lemon in cakes (see &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/07/04/iced-lemon-drizzle-cupcakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>here&lt;/a>) so it was about time I used them in a tart. I followed Mary Berry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/tarte_au_citron_94480" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tarte au citron&lt;/a> recipe almost exactly (I made the pastry by hand rather than by food processor). The recipe was much simpler than I thought it would be, and the result is so tasty. There&amp;rsquo;s a perfect amount of zing from the lemons. I think it would be just as good with a bit less sugar though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the first Mary Berry recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, (no idea how I managed that) I must test out some more!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At the end of August Jon and I went on a trip up north to Glencoe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neither of us had visited Glencoe before. On the drive up I read a bit about the history (the massacre of Glencoe) and we planned what we were going to do. We had picked out a walk the day before (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/buachailleetivebeag.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Buachaille Etive Beag&lt;/a>) that would cover two munros.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The drive in to Glencoe was fantastic. We arrived at the tiny campsite and quickly pitched our tent. There was a crazy amount of midges, and so there was a lot of running around and flapping about. As soon as the tent was up we ran for the car and headed straight to Glencoe village for some midge repellent. I counted 21 midge bites on my face alone&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we were quite tired after the terror of the midges, we decided we&amp;rsquo;d go for a drive down the Glen Etive minor road to Loch Etive. It was a lovely drive (this road featured in Skyfall) and we stopped off along the way to enjoy the views. We ate lunch at Loch Etive and we didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter any more midges.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After arriving back at our tent after eating dinner we settled in for the night. We then realised that we had left our bag full of our clothes and toiletries back at our flat!! So we had no walking clothes with us&amp;hellip; so no munros were to be bagged the next day :( I think it must&amp;rsquo;ve been really early when we fell asleep as we were both wide awake at 6am ready to start the day.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We packed up the tent and headed straight to the car park by the three sisters. We hiked up to the lost valley which was really fun and quite a scramble! We spotted an eagle circling up high too. It was a great walk and we were the only people there. We were back at the car by 10:30 and on the road to Edinburgh shortly after.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Payday also brought me a new pair of shoes! I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying I&amp;rsquo;d buy a new pair since March when my boots broke. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing my ballet style shoes to work each day, and they were in desperate need of replacement. Each time it would rain (that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of times) I&amp;rsquo;d say that I&amp;rsquo;d buy a new pair of shoes at the weekend. 6 months later and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally done it with these tan leather shoes.&lt;/p>

alt="Blueberry Muffins"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I last did some baking, but since the new season of The Great British Bake Off has started I&amp;rsquo;ve been inspired to get back at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating a lot of blueberries this summer. Finally a berry that Jon will also eat and enjoy! We&amp;rsquo;ve been taking blueberries to work with us and eating them with breakfast too. I thought it was about time I baked with them so I bought a bag of frozen berries so that they&amp;rsquo;d be there ready for me when I needed them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I baked blueberry muffins because I love blueberry muffins. Also I don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad about having them for breakfast because they contain fruit and they are a breakfasty thing. Just pretend I didn&amp;rsquo;t put that crumble topping on top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Aug/IMG_1885-copy.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="Blueberry muffins 2"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The simple recipe for the muffins (minus the crumble topping) is from the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/blueberrymuffins_67846" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>BBC&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Makes 8 muffins&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>For the muffin mix:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>110g plain flour
110g butter
65g caster sugar
2 eggs
1½ tsp baking powder
125g blueberries (fresh or frozen (not defrosted))
pinch nutmeg
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;em>For the crumble topping:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>60g light brown sugar
30g plain flour
1 tsp cinnamon
30g butter
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Begin by creaming the butter and sugar together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Aug/IMG_1869-copy.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="blueberrymuffins"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mix in the eggs for 3 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Aug/IMG_1870-copy.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="blueberrymuffins2"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the flour, baking powder and nutmeg. Stir together (but don&amp;rsquo;t over mix) and refrigerate for an hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Aug/IMG_1875-copy.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="blueberrymuffins3"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, make the crumble topping by mixing together the flour, sugar and cinnamon, then rub in the butter with your fingertips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Aug/IMG_1880-copy.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="blueberrymuffins4"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the hour is up, fold the blueberries in to the muffin mixture. Place a spoonful of the mixture in each paper case, and then top each with the crumble.&lt;/p>

>Inchcolm Island&lt;/a>. The boat to Inchcolm leaves from South Queensferry, right under the Forth Bridge. This was my first time here and we will be back to explore more of this area (I have heard it&amp;rsquo;s a great spot for sunsets too).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We had around 2 hours to spend on Inchcolm. We had a picnic, wandered around the abbey and ran away from the dive-bombing seagulls. Jon was lucky enough to spot a puffin fly past, and there were lots of seals sunbathing on the rocks. We wished we had longer to explore more of the island, although it was a very hot day so we were glad to get back for an ice-cream!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last weekend my Dad came up to visit us in Edinburgh. Since he&amp;rsquo;s been to Edinburgh a few times we decided to venture out to places just outside of the city. On Saturday we went to Rosslyn Chapel and Sunday we went on a boat to Inchcolm Island (more on that later). It was a really fun weekend!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon and I had stopped by at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.rosslynchapel.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Rosslyn chapel&lt;/a> a few years ago, but we never went inside and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the outside since it was covered in scaffolding and a huge umbrella (which was being used to dry out the chapel&amp;rsquo;s walls and roof). It&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting place, made extra famous by The Da Vinci Code, with a mass of intricate carvings everywhere. The guides also do talks inside the chapel, with lots of interesting stories including the &amp;lsquo;Apprentice Pillar&amp;rsquo; and the crazy theories people have about what lies in the buried vaults (Elvis?!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A very mysterious place and one that I&amp;rsquo;d recommend visiting! (I have no photos of the inside as photography wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a great week of weather the weekend comes along and brings with it the rain. At least we had to spend most of the day waiting in on an IKEA delivery and then 3 hours building a sofabed. At around 8pm we decided it was time to leave the flat despite the downpour. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like summer with this weather but I am so enjoying these long daylight hours.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon and I have been in this flat in Edinburgh for just over 8 months now. And we love it! The high ceilings and big windows are my favourite and there&amp;rsquo;s so much space (we even have some empty cupboards/drawers still!).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I realised looking through these photos that I must have a thing for plants or I just like to take photos of them. The olive tree in our kitchen is my favourite of all. It&amp;rsquo;s from IKEA and it&amp;rsquo;s growing pretty fast with all the sunshine we&amp;rsquo;ve had lately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken recently from around our home.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few weeks back Jon and I went mountain biking at &lt;a class="link" href="http://7stanesmountainbiking.com/Glentress---Innerleithen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>7Stanes Glentress&lt;/a>. We went to celebrate his 24th birthday (hooray!) and it was so much fun. I was pretty nervous about going since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been cycling for a couple years (not since I&amp;rsquo;d fallen off in Greece) and never been mountain biking before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Glentress has won many awards and is one of the best biking centres in the UK. It is made up of various colour coded trails for different abilities. It&amp;rsquo;s only less than an hours drive away from Edinburgh and we hired bikes from the centre when we arrived. We stuck with the green (easy) routes which were a lot of fun, and tried part of a blue route but it terrified me!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We both really enjoyed it and although I couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk the next day I would definitely go back!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>London. Two weekends ago I took a trip to London to visit a Uni friend. It was &lt;em>so much&lt;/em> fun. We went out Saturday night and slept until 12 on Sunday. We did some sightseeing, had lunch at an Indian cafe in Covent Garden, ate cookies, and (window) shopped.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weekend. Jon and I cooked our 7th recipe from &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jamies-30-Minute-Meals-Revolutionary-Approach/dp/0718154770/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jamie&amp;rsquo;s 30-Minute Meals&lt;/a>. Fantastic as always. We had Jools&amp;rsquo; Pasta. We watched part 1 of the BBC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1415175/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Yellowstone&lt;/a> on Saturday. It&amp;rsquo;s incredible. We are now planning a trip to the US next year and Yellowstone is top of the list!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shopping. We popped to Bruntsfield over the weekend for some shopping. Despite living a 10min walk away we&amp;rsquo;ve never been in to the lovely shops (only the coffee ones!). I bought this bag from &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.very-vintage-edinburgh.co.uk/home/4581709125" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Very Vintage&lt;/a> (it only opened up on Wednesday). That&amp;rsquo;s the second Scaramanga bought in two months&amp;hellip; oops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope you&amp;rsquo;re having a lovely weekend.&lt;/p>

>Pizza margherita&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I replaced the 300g bread flour stated in the recipe with 225g &amp;lsquo;00&amp;rsquo; flour and 75g finely ground semolina flour (thanks for the tip &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/recipe/pizza-dough" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jamie&lt;/a>!). I also left the dough to rise for an hour after kneading it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple years since I&amp;rsquo;ve made pizza from scratch, and although it&amp;rsquo;s not a typical &amp;lsquo;bread&amp;rsquo; I think the base counts! The pizza turned out really good, flavours were great and the only thing I think that would improve it is if I had a pizza stone and stretched the dough a little thinner.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Review: The dough is very similar to the &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/08/28/baking-bread-ciabatta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ciabatta&lt;/a> one, which I loved and have baked multiple times since. This bread came out just as tasty but with the added wow from the mozzarella, tomatoes and oregano. Seriously good and very difficult to not eat it all at once!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I like that they aren&amp;rsquo;t just crumbly oats like many of the oat bars I make become. These bars also use whole wheat flour which I think is so great as they are more like oaty brownies and they hold together really well. And they are super tasty too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last week was my Birthday week (hooray!) and I celebrated with a fantastic break in Berlin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are some of my favourite things that Jon &amp;amp; I did whilst in Berlin:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Explore.&lt;/strong> The views from the Reichstag dome. Getting our bearings and learning a little history on the free Sandemans Berlin tour. Shopping along Kurfürstendamm. Photoautomat photobooths. Many of the incredible historical sites. The transport system. Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day at the zoo. Trying to use our A-Level German skills. Kreuzberg. Tiring out our feet wandering in the sunshine. Resting our feet with a coffee and cake.&lt;/p>

>Heising&lt;/a> (just incredible). Street food. Currywurst. Southern Germany&amp;rsquo;s version of mac &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; cheese (kässpätzle). Chocolate at Fassbender &amp;amp; Rausch.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Film Festival.&lt;/strong> Berlinale. Seeing the most bizzare French film. Discovering we had tickets to an international premiere.

&lt;p>After finishing my &lt;a title="Breaking Bad Cross Stitch" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/09/10/breaking-bad-cross-stitch/" target="_blank">Breaking Bad cross stitch&lt;/a>, I really wanted to make another one and since I had leftover supplies I dove straight in. (I actually finished this cross stitch during Summer over a couple of days - it&amp;rsquo;s taken me this long to get a hoop to frame it!). I was looking for something simple to sew and after searching pinterest decided on a curly ampersand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/11/ampersand-plan.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2023" alt="ampersand plan" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/11/ampersand-plan.jpg" width="490" height="580" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After drawing out the plan on grid paper I got sewing and couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop till it was finished! Very addictive. I really liked how it came out but was unsure how to frame it. Which brings me to this weekend when I finally decided to go and buy an 8&amp;quot; hoop. I painted it black for contrast (this was actually Jon&amp;rsquo;s idea!) and it can now be displayed, finally&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Woah it&amp;rsquo;s been a while&amp;hellip; Jon and I moved in to our new flat almost 2 weeks ago and we&amp;rsquo;ve only just had the internet installed at the weekend. But hooray we are all settled in and have a long list of TV shows to catch up on! We both love our new place, the kitchen is so big and we made the most of it over the weekend when we had a flat warming - I baked ciabattas and we cooked tapas. And I made these cheesecakes. They were delicious. We had to fight over the last piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to make baked cheesecake for a while, and had a little look around for recipes and stumbled across &lt;a href="http://apumpkinandaprincess.com/2012/08/mini-snickers-cheesecakes.html" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> recipe for baked snickers cheesecakes (I totally copied the caramel sauce and chopped up snickers on top). I adapted it a little and made 2 versions (both with snickers) - Oreo base and Philadelphia, and Digestive base and Cadbury Philadelphia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t decide on my favourite&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/10/mini-baked-snickers-cheesecakes-2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997" alt="mini baked snickers cheesecakes (2)" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/10/mini-baked-snickers-cheesecakes-2.jpg" width="490" height="685" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I made them both:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mini Snickers Cheesecakes with Oreo Base&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(makes 6)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1/2 cup Oreos&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5 tbsp melted unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 egg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 snickers bar, chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>130g cream cheese&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp vanilla&lt;/li>
&lt;li>optional: caramel sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
1)  Preheat oven to 175C and line a muffin tray with 6 cupcake liners.
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Crush Oreos and mix with melted butter. Place 1 heaped tbsp in to each liner and flatten down to the bottom of the cases. Place muffin tray in the fridge whilst making the filling.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mix cream cheese and sugar together. Add the egg and vanilla, mixing until smooth. Fold in 1/2 the chopped snickers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fill the cupcake cups with the filling. Bake in the oven for 22 mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leave to cool completely (they sink down after a few minutes out of the oven). Remove the liners carefully, and top with the caramel sauce and the other 1/2 of the chopped snickers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mini Snickers Cheesecakes with Cadbury Philadelphia &lt;/strong>&lt;em>(makes 6)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1/2 cup digestives&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5 tbsp melted unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 egg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 snickers bar, chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>130g Cadbury Philadelphia&lt;/li>
&lt;li>optional: caramel sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
1)  Preheat oven to 175C and line a muffin tray with 6 cupcake liners.
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leave to cool completely (they sink down after a few minutes out of the oven). Remove the liners carefully, and top with the caramel sauce and the other 1/2 of the chopped snickers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then 28 minutes of running.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">It's week 8 and I've fallen behind! Run 1 continued from week 7,  Run 2 was 11 days later and Run 3 was urm... 3 months later. We went away to Poland and then didn't get back in to it (when Jon started work) until now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 8 Run 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments:&lt;/strong> Ran for 28 mins yay! Felt tired at around the halfway mark but kept on going and started to feel better again towards the end. It was quiet out since it&amp;rsquo;s a bank holiday which was nice as we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to keep checking behind and moving out of the way for cyclists. Only 5 more runs and we&amp;rsquo;ll have completed C25K!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 8 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Friday / Union Canal / sun
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>So it&amp;rsquo;s been 11 days since my last run. With going to the Lake District, Alton Towers and Cardiff over the past week we didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to fit in any running. We are going away to Poland on Wednesday and then it&amp;rsquo;ll be another week till we&amp;rsquo;re back. Anyway, I thought this run would be a struggle after the break but it actually went really well. We started off a lot slower than usual and Jon had a bad stitch for the first half of the run, but we were able to speed up in the second half and end with some energy still left over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 8 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W8R3ib.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1988" alt="W8R3ib" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W8R3ib.jpg" width="490" height="491" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Holyrood Park / dry&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 3 months since Run 2. I think when we are both working full-time evening runs will work best. We decided to run around Holyrood Park, doing the popular 5K route around Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat. Never done this run before with up and downhills. We decided to just pick up from where we left and hoped we still had it in us. The uphill was hard but once we were on the flat and it started to turn downhill it was great. Although at just under 3miles my hip started to hurt pretty bad. Hope it gets better soon and just needs a little rest. We both really enjoyed the run in the evening, it was quiet and felt cooler. Hooray for finishing week 8 finally!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I start my new full-time job next Tuesday, and whilst I&amp;rsquo;m not working I&amp;rsquo;ve been filling my weekdays with baking, crafting and housework. And watching back to back episodes of Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy (addicted). Last week I decided to give cross stitching a go. It&amp;rsquo;s cheap and time-consuming and I can watch as much TV as possible whilst doing it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t cross stitched since I was 15 but it&amp;rsquo;s super simple to pick up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a browse on Etsy and decided to purchase this &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/125818162/breaking-bad-cross-stitch-pattern" target="_blank">Breaking Bad cross stitch&lt;/a> pattern. Breaking Bad is an awesome TV show from beginning to end (OK we are a couple episodes from the end but we know it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be crazy good) so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be cool to remember it with this cross stitch. Jon gave it a thumbs up too which sealed the deal. I bought all the supplies online and got started on it as soon as it was all delivered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed making it and I&amp;rsquo;ve already begun my next cross stitch project. Think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a new hobby here..&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: I was a bit scared of making bagels, with the boiling stage and shaping them I thought something would probably go wrong along the way. I kept to the recipe since it had so many good reviews, and the only part I had trouble with was getting the round shape right. But they&amp;rsquo;re almost there!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This morning I baked these cookies and now there are only 2 leftover&amp;hellip; so I think that means they were a success! Double chocolate cookies are so good - the more chocolate the better. Especially when the cookies are chewy and soft and crisp on the outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I halved the recipe to make 10 so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel too guilty if they got eaten quickly (although now I wish I made more). So here&amp;rsquo;s the recipe below, which I advise you don&amp;rsquo;t halve ;)&lt;/p>

Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4.

&lt;p>Put the melted butter in a bowl (to melt it I microwave my butter in the bowl) and stir together with the brown sugar and caster sugar&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Combine with the egg and vanilla extract&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Add the flour, cocoa powder and salt and mix it all together until it becomes doughy&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Chop up the chocolate (I use Dairy Milk) and mix it in to the cookie dough&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Divide the cookie dough in to 20 evenly sized pieces and place on to trays lined with baking paper. Place the trays in the oven for 7-8 minutes. The cookies may not look cooked but they will stiffen as they cool. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to overcook them if you like them chewy inside. Leave them to cool on a wire rack, and enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday Jon &amp;amp; I, along with our friends Nat &amp;amp; Mike, set off to Loch Lomond for some hill walking. We parked up at Rowardennan to tackle Ben Lomond. The &amp;lsquo;Munro&amp;rsquo; is 974 m (3196 ft) high, making it the highest mountain we&amp;rsquo;ve walked up together. We were prepared for rain as always, but instead the sun was out the whole time and I ended up coming home with sunburnt arms&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went up via the &amp;rsquo;tourist route&amp;rsquo; and ended up going back down the same way (around 12km). We were so low on water and with the sun out we wanted to get back as soon as possible. Next time, for sure, we will take the CamelBak out with us. It was a pretty tough walk in parts during the ascent, but the way back down was so much better we were all pretty much running down it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/benlomond1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1942" alt="benlomond1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/benlomond1.jpg" width="490" height="1794" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the top we could see Ben Nevis in the distance. This was a fantastic walk and great practice for us.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: Followed the recipe exactly. I used a hand whisk with dough hook attachments as Paul advises against using your hands because the dough is so sticky.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Light and soft with a crisp crust - lovely. Great toasted, spreaded with hummus and topped with sausages for breakfast! Will definitely be baking more of these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday, Jon &amp;amp; I headed out for the Pentland hills for some hill walking. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been hill walking in a while, and since we are planning on walking up Ben Nevis by next Summer we thought we should get back into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We parked up at Flotterstone and did the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks Short Route&lt;/a>, a nice 10km/3hrs 30mins loop. I always try and print out the planned route before we go - Bing maps have an Ordnance Survey layer which is great and of course free!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1937" alt="pentlands2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t so great - one minute the sun was shining and the next it was pouring down. It was also super windy on the hills. I was almost blown away! The views were fantastic and we shall have to come back to do the 18km route in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This was a cushion cover DIY that I made before dinner this evening. Super quick and easy. I had found a couple plain white linen covers that I bought off eBay a while ago and decided to jazz one up a bit with a geometric pattern. It&amp;rsquo;s got hexagons, triangles, circles, squares and probably some more shapes thrown in!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcushionsteps.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1919" alt="bwcushionsteps" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcushionsteps.jpg" width="490" height="550" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I drew out the lines first using a pencil and ruler starting with a cross through the middle. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any measurements and just went with it. The good thing with cushion covers is they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be perfect because when they are filled they&amp;rsquo;ll be all bendy anway and you won&amp;rsquo;t see if the lines are a bit off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sharpie-Rub-a-Dub%C3%82%C2%AE-Laundry-Marker-Black/dp/B00387BTJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1333231606&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Sharpie Laundry Marker&lt;/a> to draw over the lines (and placed cardboard inside the cover so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t transfer to the back), and then drew on the circles using buttons as stencils.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcusion1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1922" alt="bwcushion1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcusion1.jpg" width="490" height="1128" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It reminds me a bit of those ball and stick models from chemistry classes. I like how the pattern came out, and for just a half hour DIY it&amp;rsquo;s great!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since the weather&amp;rsquo;s been so great lately, Jon and I decided to make the most of it and go on a little camping trip in Scotland. Our friends recommended &lt;a href="http://www.lochlomond-trossachs.org/visiting/sallochy-campsite/menu-id-335.html" target="_blank">Sallochy campsite&lt;/a> at Loch Lomond, they&amp;rsquo;ve stayed there 3 times in the last couple of weeks! It&amp;rsquo;s around 1.5hrs drive from Edinburgh and you have to book a pitch online for £5 per person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went Friday night after Jon finished work and arrived by 8pm. It was the first time using our new Vango tent which we bought last weekend off gumtree for £20. Luckily we managed to get it up OK and get the barbecue on the go within an hour :) We stayed at one of the lochside pitches which was fantastic, just a few steps from the beach which was secluded into little coves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1908" alt="lochlomond1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond1.jpg" width="490" height="733" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were out in our shorts until 11pm and it was still so bright. We got attacked by the midges and woke up to see the little pink midge bites all over us! It was pretty chilly in the night and morning. We wrapped up whilst eating our breakfast on the beach before packing up the tent (which took us way longer than pitching it&amp;hellip;) and headed up the road to Rowardennan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1909" alt="lochlomond2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond2.jpg" width="490" height="694" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went for a walk (which was supposed to be a long one but I only brought my sandals with me) along the lake. It was super quiet after just a 5 min walk from the car park. We found an empty beach and ate our lunch admiring the views and listening to the waves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along came a duck and 2 chicks. We threw them some of the crust from our sandwiches, and along came another duck with 7 teeny fluffy chicks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1910" alt="lochlomond3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/lochlomond3.jpg" width="490" height="734" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will definitely be coming back to Loch Lomond! Hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a nice weekend enjoying the sunshine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today I baked these yummy iced lemon drizzle cupcakes as I had some lemons that needed using. I had roughly 115g of caster sugar left so I used that amount to judge how much other ingredients to use. I forgot that I&amp;rsquo;d need some more caster sugar for the drizzle but I used soft brown sugar instead and it tastes just as good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1903" alt="ldcupcake2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake2.jpg" width="490" height="323" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made 9 cupcakes from the mixture, and had a bit of icing leftover. I also threw in a handful of poppy seeds which adds a bit of texture. The sponge is lovely and moist, and the icing makes them that little bit more special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1901" alt="ldcupcake3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake3.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the sponge:
115g caster sugar
115g self-raising flour
115g butter, softened
2 eggs
zest 1 lemon
handful of poppy seeds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the drizzle:
juice 1 lemon
60g brown sugar&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the icing:
zest and juice of 1 lemon
200g icing sugar&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Preheat oven to 160C. Beat together the butter and caster sugar until creamy, then slowly stir the eggs in one at a time. Add the flour, lemon zest and poppy seeds and mix together. Place the mixture in 9 cupcake cases and bake in the oven for 30mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make the lemon drizzle by mixing together the lemon and sugar. When the cupcakes are baked, remove them from the oven and prick them with a fork. Then spoon the drizzle over each cupcake and leave to cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once cooled, make the icing by combining the lemon zest and juice with the icing sugar until smooth. Pour over the cupcakes and leave to set. Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I finally have my first ever pair of hiking boots, yay! No more walking up hills in my Hunter Wellies and having sore toes and heels, although they were great at keeping the mud off me. After lots of searching online I went to McArthurGlen in Livingston and tried on a few pairs of boots I&amp;rsquo;d read good things about. In the end I chose these &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/womens/viper-womens-boot-p5978.aspx" target="_blank">Viper Women&amp;rsquo;s Waterproof Hiking Boots&lt;/a> from Mountain Warehouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me they are super comfortable, the grip is great, and they are leather too which is something I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1891" alt="boots" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Sunday we went for a walk to Cramond Island, which is a tidal island, to test out my boots. Jon wore  boots which were left in our flat by a previous tenant! I don&amp;rsquo;t think his boots are waterproof though, so he has been looking for new ones and saw they actually do a &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/mens/viper-waterproof-boot-p7481.aspx?ism=0&amp;amp;cl=BROWN" target="_blank">men&amp;rsquo;s version&lt;/a> of mine!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily the tide was out so we were able to walk across the causeway. It was seriously windy and we could barely hear each other speak. It was a lovely walk with great views of Edinburgh and the Forth Road Bridge. We walked back along the wet beach, at one point I almost got stuck and luckily my boots were tied tight or they might have come off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1892" alt="cramond" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg" width="490" height="1834" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to going for bigger walks in the future and giving these a proper test.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I graduated university on Friday with a first class mathematics degree. My 4 year student chapter is over. I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss my friends. I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss having a good timetable which may include a day off and lie-ins or early finishes. I might even miss the bus journeys and the study sessions in the library with frantic last minute revision. It&amp;rsquo;s been a fun 4 years, filled with so many good memories. All of the exams, midterms and projects caused a lot of stress at times, and sometimes I struggled with motivation to study day and night for the weeks leading up to the final exams. But it was so &lt;em>so&lt;/em> worth it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The past 4 days I&amp;rsquo;ve spent spring cleaning the flat. I&amp;rsquo;ve cleared out so much stuff and made a little money selling a few things. I&amp;rsquo;ve rearranged the bedroom furniture and switched around shelving in the kitchen cupboards. It&amp;rsquo;s kept me busy whilst Jon&amp;rsquo;s been working, and since we are planning to move soon I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be a good time to get it done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the fresh feeling from decluttering. I bought a couple things to replace some old stuff too which is always fun to do! Jon sleeps better now that we have lovely new pillows which we picked out from TK Maxx. We spent 15 minutes in the shop opening bags and feeling each pillow before we decided which ones to buy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bought that aloe vera plant above from &lt;a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/60234647/" target="_blank">IKEA&lt;/a> to replace my cactus that died over winter (I left it by the window and I think it froze to death). It&amp;rsquo;s so cool that you can break off a tip and use the gel on burns (it&amp;rsquo;s even edible apparently!) and it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to care for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also planted those seedlings above 4 days ago and they shot up after just a day. They are organic phacelia seeds that I ordered for free from &lt;a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/supportus/keepbritainbuzzing" target="_blank">Keep Britain Buzzing&lt;/a>. I scattered over just a few of the seeds from the packet but I still overdid it! Bees go crazy for these plants, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to move it outdoors at some point. If our next place doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a garden I may just have to find somewhere to scatter the rest of the seeds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope you are having a great Friday!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our friends Mike and Natalie are Polish, so lucky for us they showed us around and took us to some great places. We flew in to Wroclaw, stayed 2 nights at their family&amp;rsquo;s cabin by a lake, stayed 3 nights in an apartment in Krakow, and finally stayed 2 nights near Wroclaw at Natalie&amp;rsquo;s parents house. It was super fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a few photos  from the trip, firstly of our time at the lovely cabin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/cabin.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1826" alt="cabin" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/cabin.jpg" width="490" height="1452" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went out on a boat in the lake, sunbathed, had barbecues and sat around the fire. It was so peaceful and relaxing. I found out from uni I had achieved a 1st on the second night and celebrated around the fire :) Before we came to the cabin we did a HUGE food shop, bought so much meat and crisps, and we pretty much didn&amp;rsquo;t stop eating the whole 2 days..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After our time at the cabin, we drove down to Krakow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/krakow.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1828" alt="krakow" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/krakow.jpg" width="490" height="1468" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon and I visited Krakow 5 years ago for my 18th birthday, and this time it was Jon&amp;rsquo;s 23rd birthday! Woo! After the 3.5hr journey we arrived at the &lt;a href="http://oldcityapartments.eu/en/?ap=336&amp;amp;id=ap" target="_blank">apartment&lt;/a> and chose our rooms. After we all showered and changed out of our smoke filled clothes, we went for a lovely meal and drinks afterwards. We bought Jon a cake and they brought it out after our meal and everyone sang &amp;lsquo;Happy Birthday&amp;rsquo;, it was so funny.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next couple days we did some touristy stuff including Wawel Castle, Pharmacy Under the Eagle, Krakus Mound, etc. We visited Wedel in the main square twice for hot chocolates (they were so tasty). We also went for lunch to the same place twice since it was really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recommended by Natalie&amp;rsquo;s Aunt the restaurant at &lt;a href="http://www.hotel-francuski.com/#/restaurant" target="_blank">Hotel Francuski&lt;/a> does a special lunch deal which was a bargain. On Saturday it cost 20zl (around £4) for a 3 course meal and fruit drink. We had a vegetable soup to start, a quarter of a chicken each with boiled potatoes and salad for mains, and for dessert we had this peach with cream on sponge thing. All served off a trolley and the meat was carved in to quarters at the table too. Sunday cost 35zl as it had wine included. This time it was chicken soup, followed by pork with mashed potatoes and cabbage, and for dessert we had tiramisu. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t get over how good it all was!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our final 2 nights were spent near Wroclaw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/wroclaw.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1831" alt="wroclaw" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/wroclaw.jpg" width="490" height="727" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We spent one day in Wroclaw where we visited the main square and islands. It was super cheap, 4zl for soup and roll and 2zl (20p) for a beer at a place right on the square!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day we spent at Natalie&amp;rsquo;s parents house. It rained a lot. We popped out for a bit to visit a castle where they had been to a wedding reception the week before which was lovely, but the rain didn&amp;rsquo;t stop. We went for a sauna back at their house (there was also one of those wooden tubs with a rope that you pull to tip cold water on yourself when you get out  - so cool) and chilled out. The morning of our last day the sun came back out (boo) so we made the most of it and sunbathed by the pool (!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Had such a great time with everyone, and it was such a nice break to have before Jon started working on Monday. We also picked up a bit of Polish along the way!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am back from my holiday to Poland (more on that to follow) and am enjoying the weekend with these cookies and watching movies before Jon starts his grad job on Monday!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I brought some fresh home grown mint back from Poland, thanks to Natalie&amp;rsquo;s mum, and decided to use it to make these cookies. Mint choc chip is one of my favourite flavours, and is usually my first choice when choosing ice-cream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed my go-to &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2012/05/31/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/" target="_blank">Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies recipe&lt;/a>, but replaced the 225g flourwith 185g self-raising flour and 40g cocoa powder. I added the chopped mint, which was around 2.5 tbsp, at the end along with 200g dark chocolate chips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/mintcookiedough.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1811" alt="mintcookiedough" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/mintcookiedough.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dough made 14 regular cookies and I used the left overs (which would make 6 regular cookies) to make a giant cookie which I baked in a cake tin. I flattened it down in the pan with my knuckles to speed up the cooking time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/bigmintcookiedough.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1812" alt="bigmintcookiedough" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/bigmintcookiedough.jpg" width="490" height="412" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then cook for around 8mins, adding a couple more minutes for the larger one, and they&amp;rsquo;re done. They are super chewy and so tasty. I love the fresh taste of the mint with the dark chocolate, half of them have already been eaten..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/mintcookie.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1813" alt="mintcookie" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/06/mintcookie.jpg" width="490" height="1009" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Thursday Jon and I drove down to the Lake District. We decided to break the journey from Edinburgh to Cardiff by staying overnight at Grasmere, and on Friday continuing on to Alton Towers and arriving in Cardiff in the evening. It was a 3hr drive to Grasmere and driving through the Lake District was gorgeous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We booked the &lt;a href="http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/grasmere-butharlyp-howe" target="_blank">Youth Hostel&lt;/a> on Monday, and the only one which had private rooms still available was the one in Grasmere. Grasmere is known as the place William Wordsworth lived, and apparently he described it as &amp;ldquo;the loveliest spot that man hath ever found&amp;rdquo;. The youth hostel was in this lovely converted Victorian mansion:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/YHA-grasmere.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1775" alt="YHA grasmere" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/YHA-grasmere.jpg" width="490" height="731" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a great, cheap place to stay. We spotted 3 deer just outside the hostel and lots of rabbits running about. We went for a walk, and having done some research before heading out we decided upon the &lt;a href="http://where2walk.co.uk/lake_district/lake_discoveries/easedale-tarn-from-grasmere/" target="_blank">walk to Easedale Tarn&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1778" alt="easedale" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale.jpg" width="490" height="1439" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a nice and easy walk, although it rained the whole time. I took a few too many photos of lambs along the first quarter of the route (they were so cute!), but as my legs started to get rather wet we sped up the hill along the waterfalls. The views were fantastic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We reached Easedale Tarn, and there were just a few people about so it was nice and quiet. Wish we had waterproof trousers though! On the way back towards Grasmere the ground was very wet and muddy. There were stepping stones almost the whole way which helped a lot (luckily I had wellies on so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad), but some parts it seemed we were walking in a stream!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale-tarn.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1777" alt="easedale tarn" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale-tarn.jpg" width="490" height="1270" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time we got back to the youth hostel we were soaked through and we turned the heating up to full to start drying out our shoes and all of our clothes. Jon had a nap for an hour whilst I read a book, and before we knew it it was dinner time! Which meant we had missed having a look around the village shops. I really wanted to go to the &lt;a href="http://www.grasmeregingerbread.co.uk/" target="_blank">Grasmere Gingerbread Shop&lt;/a>, but a look from the outside had to do instead&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/grasmere-gingerbread.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1773" alt="grasmere gingerbread" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/grasmere-gingerbread.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ate at a pub in Grasmere called The Lamb Inn which was yummy, and finished it off with apple crumble and ice-cream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day we woke up early and headed down to Alton Towers. We were there from 10-5 and luckily it stayed dry the whole time. It was super quiet too, with the longest queue being 15mins. So fun!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/altontowers.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1776" alt="altontowers" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/altontowers.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would love to do some more exploring of the Lake District, hopefully with a bit less rain next time though!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then 25 minutes running.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s week 7 and still enjoying it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 7 Run 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/W7R1ib.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1746" alt="W7R1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/W7R1ib.jpg" width="490" height="490" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Union Canal / sun
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We tried a new route today straight from our flat and onto the canal from there. It felt great to have a change of scenery and it made it seem like a shorter distance that way. It also felt easier than the last run. Although very red faced by the end of it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 7 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
 &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W7R2ib.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1751" alt="W7R2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W7R2ib.jpg" width="490" height="490" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Wednesday / Union Canal / wind and rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today we had to run a day later than we should have because Jon had exams Monday and Tuesday. I think that made this run harder, as we were both feeling it in our legs today! I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying seeing our progress on the nike+ app, with graphs of our pace etc and how much we&amp;rsquo;ve improved since the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 7 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
 &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W7R3ib.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1755" alt="W7R3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W7R3ib.jpg" width="490" height="490" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Union Canal / sun&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Again we&amp;rsquo;ve had to wait 3 days till this run, exams getting in the way! All finished now though so we can get back into a better routine. Think we are going to stick with running straight from our flat too, now that we are more confident. Still felt pretty tired at the end of the run. The nike+ app told us we&amp;rsquo;d completed 5k in 32'40&amp;quot;, which would&amp;rsquo;ve included some of the walking. I hope by the end of week 9 we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do 5k running in 30 mins, but even to run 5k straight shall be an accomplishment! :)&lt;/p>

On Friday I had my last ever exam at University. 4 years of studying are over and it's on to the big wide world now! Since I've finished I've been tidying and clearing out the flat, it gets so messy during revision times and I'm so happy to get rid of all of my notes that filled 8 lever arched files. I can now do fun things again - woohoo!!
&lt;p>Hope you are having a great bank holiday weekend :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I&amp;rsquo;d heard some people say that this run is a struggle. After doing the 20 min run it seems like this one will be fine, but that confidence can mean running faster and lead to getting tired quicker. So I made sure to keep it steady and start off slowly, and it went really well. This run was the farthest and quickest of them all that we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded on the nike+ app, getting closer to that 5k!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>On Monday I had my first exam in the morning, so instead we went for a run the next day. It was really windy and it made it quite hard to run on the way out. At around the halfway mark I had a bad stitch which made it a struggle and I felt so tired at the end of it. It makes me nervous for the 25 min run that&amp;rsquo;s coming next!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>It rained today so no nike+. It started off really well, but between 12.5 and 20 mins was the hardest. We kept at a steady pace throughout and pushed through it. Felt good afterwards, and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome to think that 6 weeks ago we were running a minute at a time. Only 3 weeks to go, and no more walking between runs from here on!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>The wind has been so bad these last couple days and it continued today. It made it difficult for our run out but helped with the run back. It was 2 runs of 8 mins each which felt good as after 1 run there was only one more to go! At the end of the run we both felt we had energy to keep going. I love how these runs are breaking up revision, always looking forward to the next one. I&amp;rsquo;m nervous for the next one though as there won&amp;rsquo;t be any walking in between, Jon thinks it&amp;rsquo;ll be fine though so we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 5 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Wednesday / Union Canal / rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We did it!! It rained heavily all the way through the run. I had my rainproof coat on with hood up which kept most of the rain off me. Jon&amp;rsquo;s coat isn&amp;rsquo;t waterproof so he had it worse, but regardless of the rain we did the full 20 mins! It actually felt really good. I was worried I would struggle but once we started and got into a rhythm, I felt like I could keep on going. Jon didn&amp;rsquo;t take his phone with the nike+ app on because of the rain (both of our pockets were soaked through after) so we don&amp;rsquo;t know how we did for pace etc, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how next week goes!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Our first 5 min run today. The sun was out and we actually took our gloves off halfway as we started to sweat. Felt really good after the run, and pleased with the progress and improvement since week one. Also, the daffodils are finally coming out!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Out early this morning as we had to park at a pay &amp;amp; display spot last night as there were no spaces left so the car needed moving. Along the canal there were lots of kids and parents doing the school run and commuters cycling so we had to run in single file most of the time. Both of our legs were still aching after we &lt;a title="Walking in the Pentlands" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/04/08/walking-in-the-pentlands/">walked in the Pentlands&lt;/a> on Saturday, so we struggled a bit to keep them moving.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / clouds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Nice and quiet along the canal today. Found this run quite hard, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because for the Thursday runs we always have 2 days of rest before it. I had a stitch on the final run and found it really hard to keep running but I was determined not to stop and made it. I&amp;rsquo;m quite nervous for next week as it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;rsquo;transitional&amp;rsquo; week which transitions from running mixed with walking to just running. Should be able to run 20 mins non-stop by the end of the week. Will see how that goes!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Saturday Jon and I went for a walk in the Pentland hills with our friends Natalie and Mike. The sun came out and it was almost 10°C so we had to make the most of it! We parked near the ski centre and walked up the steep hill, following the Capital View trail. It was really slippery with ice and mud in places and so we slipped a lot on the way down (Natalie in particular) and once you started sliding it was hard to stop!! We are all planning to invest in walking boots in the future :D&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On the weekend I fancied something sweet and spotted a baked doughnut recipe from &lt;a href="http://www.krissys-creations.com/2011/06/baked-doughnuts.html" target="_blank">Krissy&amp;rsquo;s Creations&lt;/a> on Pinterest. Since I already had all the ingredients I went ahead and baked them. I&amp;rsquo;ve never made any type of doughnut before, but these were pretty easy to make and a lot healthier than fried ones. The doughnut holes remind me of mini iced buns!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/bakeddoughnut.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1653" alt="bakeddoughnut" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/bakeddoughnut.jpg" width="490" height="696" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much like fried doughnuts in taste and texture, but they&amp;rsquo;re tasty regardless! And I think they look pretty cute too :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. I used a 2 inch and 3.5 inch round cutter to make the doughnut shapes and kept to &lt;a href="http://www.krissys-creations.com/2011/06/baked-doughnuts.html" target="_blank">the recipe&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>C25K: Week Three</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/c25k-week-three/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 09:00:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/c25k-week-three/</guid><description>&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/W3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1629" alt="W3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/W3.jpg" width="490" height="243" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Holyrood Park / light snow&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today we went for a drive to Holyrood Park for our run and left a little later than usual. I had cereal when I woke up and it was around an hour later we went for the run. So I had a bad stitch during the first run, and when it came to the 3 min run I was really struggling but kept going. Jon thought I was going to cry..! So we paused the podcast after the run for a minute whilst I tried to get rid of it, and when it calmed down we carried on. We decided to try a different route and ended up running up a very steep muddy hill, but by the time we were up my stitch was gone and I had a sudden rush of energy. We were both very tired after and I think from now on I won&amp;rsquo;t eat breakfast until we get back home, and we won&amp;rsquo;t be doing that route again until we are fitter!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I didn&amp;rsquo;t eat breakfast before we went out today but took a banana with me for after the run (we are usually up at 8 and out around 8.45ish). We both felt a lot better this time and felt we could keep going on for longer. We noticed that this week takes less time than the previous weeks, and we cover 3.5km compared to 4.1km previously. Excited for the next run!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today felt warmer as the sun kept peeking out. Sticking with the not eating until we get home which is working out well. We ran alongside a kayak and a canal boat which was cool. Again we felt like we could run more, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we feel about that next week with the longer runs..!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>It was very cold today (as usual)! Ran along the canal again, this time there were a couple rowing boats out which was quite funny as during the walking parts they would overtake us and then the running parts we would overtake them. Jon used his headphones too whilst using the nike+ app which was cool because it let us know whenever we&amp;rsquo;d run a mile. Felt good during/after the run and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next :)&lt;/p>

Uni is stressful at the moment (Dissertation due on Thurs!) but we are both finding that running is helping de-stress us and gets us away from a computer and in to the fresh air which can only be a good thing :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I was worried it would be slippy out today but luckily the path along the canal had been cleared. Today was probably the least windy it&amp;rsquo;s been since we began and that definitely helped with the running, the sun even came out at one point! Ran a bit further along the canal until we were on an aqueduct that runs over the Water of Leith. We did a sprint finish on the last run, which tired us both out after! On to week 3&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I thank Jon for these cookies. We went to Lidl yesterday to grab some pizza, and whenever we&amp;rsquo;re in Lidl a pack of toffee waffles (also called caramel wafers) always seem to end up in our shopping. They are so good and the added cinnamon flavour in these ones make them even better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cw.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1608" alt="cw" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cw.jpg" width="490" height="343" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make chocolate and toffee cookies for a while now, and Jon suggested using the toffee waffles. Today I made them, and oh are they good! They are sooo chewy and I love how the caramel oozes out from the waffles, and with the dairy milk, well they&amp;rsquo;re certainly full of sugar! I halved my &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2012/05/31/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/" target="_blank">Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies recipe&lt;/a> to make the cookie dough, and used 2 broken up waffles and around 15 blocks of dairy milk (I cut each block in half), and managed to make 12 cookies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cwcookie2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1609" alt="cwcookie2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/cwcookie2.jpg" width="490" height="710" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are seriously good warm when they&amp;rsquo;re still a bit gooey&amp;hellip; Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been into running, whenever I went for a run I&amp;rsquo;d come home and feel so tired that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to go again! I think that made me not enjoy it - pushing myself too hard and feeling defeated. I think the last time I went out for a run was 2 years ago. Then, last week Jon and I were talking about fitness and how we want to get fitter but we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough money to go to a leisure centre blah blah. We enjoy hill walking but that&amp;rsquo;s more of a weekend thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We talked about running and looked at the &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/LiveWell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k.aspx" target="_blank">Couch to 5k plan&lt;/a> that we&amp;rsquo;d heard good things about before but never properly looked into it. The 9-week plan slowly eases you into running, where you begin by mixing running and walking together and slowly build up to running a 5k. And then we decided to do it. 2 days later I bought some budget running shoes and the next day we went for our first run.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then alternate 60 seconds of running and 90 seconds of walking, for a total of 20 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Sunday / Holyrood Park / rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Actually ran week 2 run 1. I accidentally put the wrong podcast on my iPod.. oops. But got through it and felt good afterwards, without feeling like my body was melting :) My left heel rubbed a bit in my new shoes, think it&amp;rsquo;s just from wearing them in though. We are both looking forward to our next run!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. the next 2 days both of our legs ached haha we need to keep it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Tuesday / Holyrood Park / snow &amp;amp; wind
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Back on to Week 1 as I&amp;rsquo;ve sorted my iPod out now! The weather was really bad, strong winds and snow made this feel like such a workout. My hands were numb and it felt like I was running backwards when the wind was against me as I was running up a slight incline. Apparently there was a weather warning, but it made it a challenge and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did it! After coming home and having a warm shower it was worth it :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1572" alt="Camera 360" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R3.jpg" width="490" height="653" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / sunshine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Yay the sun came out, although it&amp;rsquo;s still cold around 1°C it felt so much warmer. We tried a different route closer to our flat, it was more sheltered and we both really enjoyed it. Also saw signs that spring is almost here - can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it to get warmer. I felt this run was a lot easier than the last 2, that&amp;rsquo;s probably mainly due to the weather but hopefully I am getting fitter too! Both excited to start week 2 over the weekend!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Do you run? Have you ever tried the C25K plan or similar? &lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last week whilst at university, there was a lady outside the student shop with a table filled with plates of cookies, flapjacks and muffins. She was giving them away for free to promote some new products they were launching in the shop. So I picked up a muffin, I had no idea what it was but it looked good. It turned out to be a lemon and poppy seed muffin and it was delicious! So I wanted to recreate that flavour, but instead of muffins I chose to make cupcakes with lemon buttercream icing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1556" alt="lemonpoppy2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy2.jpg" width="490" height="693" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed the BBC GoodFood&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/470636/lemon-and-poppyseed-cupcakes" target="_blank">lemon and poppyseed cupcakes recipe&lt;/a> to make 12 cupcakes, although I halved the icing quantity (so glad I did!) but still used the juice of one lemon. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t bother toasting the poppy seeds, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what difference that would make? The end result is yummy nevertheless! I love the texture with the poppy seeds and the zing of lemon is so good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think they would still be tasty without the icing if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something with less sugar (and butter!) or maybe instead of buttercream making a lemon drizzle topping instead.&lt;/p>

I had a fantastic one :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, as I share my birthday with 2 friends (they&amp;rsquo;re twins!), we all went out in Edinburgh to celebrate. I bought a new dress with my birthday cash from ASOS, this one to be precise:&lt;/p>

So to accompany the sunshine I&amp;rsquo;ve painted my nails in a bright new nail varnish that I bought for my birthday. It&amp;rsquo;s Rimmel 60 Second nail polish in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rimmel-Nail-Polish-Second-Coralicious/dp/B0046U82I2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top" target="_blank">Coralicious&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I love this colour! It&amp;rsquo;s so bright and fresh, and makes me smile each time the colour catches my eye. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried Rimmel nail varnish before, and I must say I&amp;rsquo;m impressed. The brush is so wide which makes application super easy and quick. And it dries within the 60 seconds as advertised. It&amp;rsquo;s fine with just one coat, but if you want it extra bright I&amp;rsquo;d go for 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can see this bottle will be getting lots of use over summer!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never baked a treacle tart before. In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever baked any kind of tart. I received a &lt;a href="http://www.kitchencraft.co.uk/catalogue/detail.aspx?pid=17967&amp;amp;gid=41192&amp;amp;pg=5ulcAD71%2bPexhaYfvBsz%2fHT6rBVSpj1j" target="_blank">loose base fluted tin&lt;/a> for Christmas that I&amp;rsquo;d been wishing for, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to make any kind of tart, flan, or quiche since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which brings me to this week and my first attempt - Treacle Tart from Lorraine Pascal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943/ref=cm_cmu_pg_t" target="_blank">Baking Made Easy&lt;/a>. Treacle Tart is something me and Jon both really enjoy, it&amp;rsquo;s old-fashioned and super easy to make. It&amp;rsquo;s great straight from the oven with vanilla ice-cream, and I love how the top came out a little bit chewy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/treacletart2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1504" alt="treacletart2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/treacletart2.jpg" width="490" height="627" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>500 g sweet shortcrust pastry (I made mine from scratch or you can use shop-bought)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>450 g golden syrup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zest and juice of 1 lemon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>60 g butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tsp ground ginger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>250 g breadcrumbs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
[ordered_list style="decimal"]
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Get the oven on to 180°C. Roll out the pastry to about 3 mm thick and line the tart tin. Prick the base lightly with a fork and place in the fridge for around 20 mins to firm it up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the pastry case from the fridge. Take a piece of baking paper and cover the pastry. Fill it with baking beans or dried beans (I used lentils) and 'blind bake' in the oven for 15-20 mins. The edges should be lightly coloured and the base dry to the touch. Remove the beans and paper and return the pastry to the oven for 5 mins, until golden.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To make the filling, put the golden syrup, lemon zest and juice, butter and ground ginger into a large pan and melt gently over a low heat. Stir in the breadcrumbs, then pour the mixture into the pastry case and bake for 20-25 mins, until lightly browned and set.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
[/ordered_list]
&lt;p>Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On my birthday, Jon and I headed into town for lunch. I&amp;rsquo;d read great things about Papii on &lt;a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d2212342-Reviews-Papii-Edinburgh_Scotland.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor&lt;/a> and since it&amp;rsquo;s in the top ten places to eat in Edinburgh it had to be tried!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we were not disappointed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jon went with the lemon and coriander chicken sub and I had the mezzano, salami and olive melt. Washed down with a flat white coffee and a very merry berry smoothie. All sooo good. And the coffee art is awesome. Birthday lunches are my favourite and Papii made it even better.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday I baked myself a birthday cake. I was really in the mood to bake something and it was my birthday the next day so I thought why not! It&amp;rsquo;s oh so chocolatey and delicious, just the way I like :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did cheat and buy a box mix (Betty Crocker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.bettycrocker.co.uk/Our-Products/Cake-Mixes/Devils-Food-Cake" target="_blank">Devil&amp;rsquo;s Food Cake&lt;/a>) because I wanted to give it a go and be a bit lazy. But I did make the frosting from scratch and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing! I followed the recipe for nutella cloud frosting from &lt;a href="http://sweetapolita.com/2012/03/chocolate-birthday-cupcakes-with-nutella-cloud-frosting/" target="_blank">Sweetapolita&lt;/a>, and it really does have an airy cloud-like texture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s see how long this cake will last&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bread 8/15: Big Fat Salt &amp;amp; Pepper Breadsticks from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1358520787&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Lorraine Pascale’s Baking Made Easy&lt;/a>&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/eight-strand_plaited_57815" target="_blank">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I made 12 breadsticks as stated in the recipe, each 25cm long. I shaped half of them into twists and used chilli salt, black pepper, poppy seeds and sea salt as toppings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: They&amp;rsquo;re great for dipping, but I found them quite chewy on their own. I also would have preferred them to be thinner, perhaps by dividing the dough into more sticks or making extra long ones. The chilli salt ones were my favourite.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: So I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to bake 15 loaves by 2013 but I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue on anyway! I halved the recipe to make one loaf and added poppy seeds on top, everything else I kept to the recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: One of my favourites so far. It only needs 15mins to rise in a warm place, and then goes straight in the oven (not preheated) with a tray of water underneath, simple. Oh and it tastes delicious too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for the comment that shared this lovely recipe, and if you have any more recommendations of breads please leave a comment :)&lt;/p>

But enough about that, the last 2 weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve spent back home in Cardiff have been awesome and I wanted to share a few photos of my holidays :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I baked these delicious brownies from &lt;a href="http://www.browneyedbaker.com/2010/10/08/the-baked-brownie/" target="_blank">Brown Eyed Baker&lt;/a>, and oh they&amp;rsquo;re good! They&amp;rsquo;re so rich and dense and not cakey - just how I think they should be! And I love the thin crackly crust on top too. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of richness in them - 3 big bars of dark chocolate, almost a whole block of butter and 2cups of sugar (to make 24) - but if eaten in bite sized chunks they are sooo delicious! I ate mine warm with ice-cream, mmm&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

I had my last exam today and it went really well. I&amp;rsquo;m so relieved to finish studying and know that all my hard work will hopefully pay off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So yesterday was mine and Jon&amp;rsquo;s 7 years-of-being-a-couple anniversary. We&amp;rsquo;re celebrating this weekend by cooking a yummy meal together and allowing ourselves to put the electric heating on ha!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just wanted to share a couple things that I gave Jon, starting with his card and wrap:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4040.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1384" alt="cardwrap" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4040.jpg" width="490" height="243" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/61963605/love-is-exponential-letterpress-card?ref=sr_gallery_9&amp;amp;ga_search_query=cards+love&amp;amp;ga_order=most_relevant&amp;amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;amp;ga_ship_to=GB&amp;amp;ga_page=2&amp;amp;ga_search_type=handmade&amp;amp;ga_facet=handmade/paper_goods/cards/letterpresscards+love" target="_blank">this card&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s cute + math related = yay! It&amp;rsquo;s from &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/FatBunnyPress?ref=seller_info" target="_blank">FatBunnyPress on Etsy&lt;/a> - totally recommended. Also that pacman wrapping paper is just printable paper from &lt;a href="http://www.minieco.co.uk/halloween-printable-wrap/" target="_blank">Minieco&lt;/a> which is free. The site has lots of printable wraps and other cool templates; I want to try making these &lt;a href="http://www.minieco.co.uk/paper-gems/" target="_blank">paper gems&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.minieco.co.uk/3d-paper-diamonds/" target="_blank">diamonds&lt;/a>. Jon gave me origami paper too so they will be getting made!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4042.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1390" alt="book" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4042.jpg" width="490" height="243" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a 7x7&amp;quot; book made from &lt;a href="http://www.blurb.co.uk/" target="_blank">Blurb&lt;/a> of our time in Edinburgh as students. I&amp;rsquo;m so impressed by the quality. I used Bookify to put it all together, just dragged the pics in and played around with the pre-made page layouts, so easy! I think it looks great, and it&amp;rsquo;s something we&amp;rsquo;ll look back on and laugh at (there are a lot of embarrassing photos in there). The majority of pages are made up of photo grids (2x2 and 3x3), and there&amp;rsquo;s 40pages in total. Here are some photos of a few pages, poor lighting doesn&amp;rsquo;t do them justice unfortunately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4043.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1391" alt="photobook" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/12/IMGP4043.jpg" width="490" height="1135" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want a good quality photobook, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend &lt;a href="http://www.blurb.co.uk/" target="_blank">Blurb&lt;/a>. I found a 30% off code online too, so have a Google if you fancy getting one for yourselves or as a gift!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope you have a lovely weekend :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>// To Jon: I want to say how thankful I am of you, for keeping me sane during studying and making me laugh hysterically over things like &amp;ldquo;trudagrapevin&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Ranjit says..&amp;rdquo;. This next years going to be full of changes, like where we&amp;rsquo;ll live and having graduate jobs (fingers crossed ha)&amp;hellip; but I am so excited to do it all with you! I love you so much xx p.s. can&amp;rsquo;t wait to fill up our huge book - I love it! //&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Edinburgh Castle</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/edinburgh-castle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 15:01:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/edinburgh-castle/</guid><description>&lt;p>After living in Edinburgh for over 3 years, Jon and I have finally visited the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/" target="_blank">castle&lt;/a>! We went when it was free (over St. Andrew&amp;rsquo;s Day weekend) at 9.30 am on Saturday. It was pretty cold up there but luckily there was lots of places to explore indoors too. I really enjoyed it, especially seeing the sparkly crown jewels :) We spent around 2 hours looking around - a nice study break!&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">4 weeks today = Christmas holidays begin!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">The countdown begins, and until then I shall drink lots of tea and eat lots of sugary snacks to keep me going through revision. These are my penultimate exams at university so I'm starting to stress, but I'm looking forward to getting them done and driving back home to Cardiff for Christmas :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bread 6/15: &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/eight-strand_plaited_57815" target="_blank">Plaited Loaf&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: OK, so I was supposed to do the eight-strand loaf as in the recipe, but I tried and failed&amp;hellip; my kitchen is too small I couldn&amp;rsquo;t spread the 8 strands out wide enough and I just went for a simple 3 strand loaf in the end. One day I will do it, but for now this is good enough for me :p&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Yummy and soft. Think it could do with a bit more salt, I&amp;rsquo;ve just run out so there&amp;rsquo;s only a teeny bit in it. We ate around half the loaf with leftover sausage casserole for lunch, and tomorrow we&amp;rsquo;ll have some with soup! So good with this cold weather.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s now a month till exams and it&amp;rsquo;s starting to really sink in that by April uni will be over, forever. So I&amp;rsquo;m making sure I make the most of it and come out with a good degree, which means most of my time is taken up with studying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I try to keep one weekend day mostly free of work, and today is one of those days :) This morning Jon and I went to the cinema to see a screening of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/" target="_blank">Argo&lt;/a> which was really good (and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it), followed by some food shopping and some online catch-up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a few things I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/cows.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351" title="cows" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/cows.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="656" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went for a walk in the Pentlands with some friends when the sun came out. It was so muddy and we went the steepest possible way up the hill. The way down was particularly funny when everyone slipped in the mud except for me ha! But we do really need to invest in some walking boots :p We also stumbled across this gathering of highland cattle which completely blocked our path, so we patiently waited for them to move as we were too scared to get close!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/rolocookies.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1352" title="rolocookies" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/rolocookies.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I baked &lt;a title="Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/" target="_blank">cookies&lt;/a>, rolo ones, that lasted 2 days at most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/halloween.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1353" title="halloween" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/halloween.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to a Halloween party as a skeleton! The pic on the left was taken a couple of days before the party when I did a trial run of the make-up so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit rough. Was a great party and I only spent £2 on my &amp;lsquo;costume&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/sparklers.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1354" title="sparklers" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/sparklers.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="150" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally today I picked up some &lt;a href="http://www.tesco.com/free-sparklers/free-sparklers.pdf" target="_blank">free sparklers&lt;/a> from Tesco (click the link to get the coupon), a few of us plan on going up Blackford Hill to watch some fireworks tomorrow night, can&amp;rsquo;t wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, I&amp;rsquo;m going to put on the kettle for a hot chocolate and try to apply for some jobs. Have a nice Sunday!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: Followed the recipe exactly, although I found the dough to be quite sticky so added a touch more flour when I was kneading to stop it from sticking.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: This is a quick bread and not a yeast one. I added 1/2 tsp of paprika and used mature cheddar, and finally got some use out of my chives! I also sprinkled some of the cheddar on top of the dough before baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Loved how quick it was to make with no waiting around to rise. The smell coming from the oven was so good it was hard to wait for the bread to cool, and it sure does taste as good as it smells. Great flavour and texture.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s such a big book that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I could finish it. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad I chose a big project to put together for my first scrapbook as I learnt lots along the way. I started from the beginning and went through page by page, I think the improvements can be seen as the book progresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/travel-scrapbook2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1299" title="travel scrapbook" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/travel-scrapbook2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="276" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always had making a scrapbook of the trip in my mind, so I made sure to keep hold of all those little bits and pieces whilst travelling to include in the book. This included the usual things like leaflets, receipts, menus, tickets, napkins, wristbands, tags, as well as random stuff like a drink stirrer and paper hat. Cool to look back on and great fillers too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/favouritepages.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1289" title="favouritepages" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/favouritepages.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="734" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pages above are my favourites. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because of the colours and how the pages are filled without looking cluttered. I also like the circle cut of the middle page to keep the pages flowing together. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just because they feature doughnuts and ice-cream&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/pocket1.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1292" title="pocket" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/pocket1.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are quite a few pockets in the book which I struggled with at the start. Towards the end I found what worked best for me, and this was cutting down half a page and using the scrap to make a pocket to stick back on to the half page. It seems to be the sturdiest and it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier to turn the page. For the pocket above I painted it black and cut out a window which I then covered in acetate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My next scrapbook I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of making is a minibook, perhaps 4x6 - a lot smaller and manageable that way!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Supplies: Fancy Pants patterned paper (it&amp;rsquo;s the little things), American Crafts remarks stickers, Echo Park collection kit (for the record), Paperchase travel stickers, Freckled Fawn washi tape. I used a &lt;a href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/invt/00333125/" target="_blank">Paperchase kraft scrapbook&lt;/a> as the base, and Dovecraft adhesive runners and a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pilot-Rollerball-Rubber-Retractable-0-5mm/dp/B0027IXR8K/ref=wl_it_dp_o_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;colid=366HG8GNNQRHA&amp;amp;coliid=I1LW4TNRBEVZRJ" target="_blank">Pilot G205 pen&lt;/a> throughout the book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scrapbook: Road Trip USA</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/scrapbook-road-trip-usa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2012 17:56:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/scrapbook-road-trip-usa/</guid><description>&lt;p>{Photo heavy post} It&amp;rsquo;s finally finished!!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bread 3/15 : olive oil bread from &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1162642/" target="_blank">BBC GoodFood&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I added a handful of chopped green olives to the dough on top of the 2tbsp olive oil. As others have also commented on the recipe, the bread did go brown quite quickly so I covered with foil and turned down the heat to 210C halfway through. As well as a serrated knife I also need a really sharp knife or a razor blade to score the loaf properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Great flavour, could easily make this one again. That&amp;rsquo;s our sandwich bread sorted for the next couple days!&lt;/p>

Sorry it&amp;rsquo;s been a while, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing much worth sharing since I&amp;rsquo;ve been back in uni and settling in. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched my degree course from Maths with Finance to just Maths which I am so much happier with, and am now back in the swing of things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s some pics Jon took on his phone - the Samsung Galaxy S2 - of things we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently (minus the cookie pics which came from my camera). I think some of them came out pretty well!&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">When we turned around from that viewpoint above this is what we saw...&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">..Zebras! Through a large fence is Edinburgh Zoo, which backs on to a path around the hill. We could hear kids shouting from inside the zoo and that's when we noticed that the zebras were right up by the fence near us! Gotta love seeing a herd of zebras whilst walking through the woods.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: I used about 3/4 of the sugar stated for the filling and had to do the slicing stage in halves as my kitchen doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough space. I found it quite fiddly arranging the slices, and I think if I could do them so neatly as shown on Joy&amp;rsquo;s blog it would look a lot better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: so yummy and sweet, we ate half of it just after it came out the oven. However it does takes quite a while to make and requires some patience ;)&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s our first &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; walk in the Hills and we both really enjoyed it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1214&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;490&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1214" title="allermuir hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326" />&lt;/a> Allermuir Hill (493m)[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got the ski lift going part of the way up which saved our legs a bit of work. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to ride on it before and seeing as &lt;a title="European Heritage Days" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/european-heritage-days/" target="_blank">it was free&lt;/a> it had to be done. Great views at the top of the slopes too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>How cute are those thatched cottages?! The walk passes through the lovely Swanston village, where apparently Robert Louis Stevenson spent his summer days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took us a little over 2 hours to complete the loop, and our legs were aching by the end of it. There were a few steep parts that got our heart pumping. We need to do this more often and would love to do the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks&lt;/a> walk in the future!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bread 1/15 : white loaf from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1347122133&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Lorraine Pascale&amp;rsquo;s Baking Made Easy&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I liked that it used a &amp;lsquo;squidge&amp;rsquo; of honey rather than any sugar. After 10mins the loaf had already coloured as much as I wanted it to go so I covered the top with foil to stop it going any darker. For my first loaf it was nice and easy, although I really need to get a serrated knife!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Lovely soft bread that tastes as good as a plain white loaf can. Great with butter or nutella, &lt;em>especially when it&amp;rsquo;s still warm&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>{ I chose this bread as my first loaf for its simplicity. I figured if there&amp;rsquo;s no disasters with this then I can go ahead with my plan to bake 15 different breads by 2013.

&lt;p>Jon and I will be heading to the &lt;a href="http://www.midlothian.gov.uk/info/200131/snowsports_centre" target="_blank">Midlothian Snowsports Centre&lt;/a>, where tomorrow you can use the chairlift for free, and going for a walk in the Pentlands. We&amp;rsquo;d planned on doing a walk here before we found out it was free, so we&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be taking advantage of that and saving our legs a little bit ;p&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Walked&lt;/em> in the Pentland Hills in the rain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Shopped&lt;/em> in TK Maxx. Jon picked up an outdoorsy coat and I found some glass cups (we only had one left) which we managed to get the price down to 50p per cup!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Watched&lt;/em> 2 free movies at the cinema. Hope Springs and Untouchable - I recommend both, &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/" target="_blank">Untouchable&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Explored&lt;/em> a part of Edinburgh we hadn't been to before. More on that below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Enjoyed&lt;/em> our last week before University begins.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div>[hr]&lt;/div>
The part of Edinburgh we went to was a bit of a spur of the moment thingy. After driving back from TK Maxx, I spotted a sign for the &lt;a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/vc/index.html" target="_blank">Royal Observatory&lt;/a> and thought we should check it out. We drove past the lovely shops in Morningside and through Blackford, past some gorgeous (and huge) houses that we dreamed of living in, and finally up the steep hill to the Observatory.
&lt;p>We parked up and it seemed like we weren&amp;rsquo;t in the city anymore. We were on &lt;a href="http://www.fohb.org/new/index.htm" target="_blank">Blackford Hill&lt;/a> which is a local nature reserve  with fields of grass, crags, a lake and river. So we decided to walk up to the top of hill.  It was such a windy day and at the top I struggled to stand straight! The views from the top were the best I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Edinburgh (a 360° panorama). It was also really quiet, just a few dog walkers and that was it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These photos were taken on my phone so they&amp;rsquo;re pretty bad quality. [Jon&amp;rsquo;s just renewed his phone contract and now has a Samsung Galaxy S2 (woo!) so I can use the camera on that when I don&amp;rsquo;t have my proper camera with me now :D]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1195" title="blackford hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1063" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love finding new places like this. This would be an awesome place to come and watch fireworks or for a picnic in the sun. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised it&amp;rsquo;s not so well known!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They survived!! After 2 weeks away in Cardiff I came back to my flat to find my herbs hadn&amp;rsquo;t died. In fact, the soil from the chives and basil was still nice and moist. As you can see from the pics they aren&amp;rsquo;t looking too great though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The parsley in particular has gone quite wild. I wish I thinned that out earlier on since it&amp;rsquo;s all knotted together now. Not really sure what to do with the chives either. The basil on the other hand is looking fine, I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to thin it down to just one plant (moving the far right big one in to the middle of the pot) but then I might end up with nothing left&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We went surfing at Newgale beach. The waves were big and frequent, and the sun was out shining. So much fun!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the evening we had a yummy meal at &lt;a href="http://www.thecambrianinn.co.uk/index.html" target="_blank">The Cambrian Inn&lt;/a> in Solva, then went for a walk along Newgale beach and saw the sunset. It was lovely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/broadhaven.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174" title="broadhaven" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/broadhaven.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="654" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a good nights sleep (and yeh we played the obligatory game of Scrabble in the evening) we found that the weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t so good, so before the rain came we walked to the beach at Broad Haven. We skimmed rocks and my Dad showed us the coal and iron in the cliffs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On the drive home we stopped off at &lt;a href="http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/kidwellycastle/?lang=en" target="_blank">Kidwelly Castle&lt;/a>. The castle was great but we didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of the statue &amp;lsquo;art&amp;rsquo; that was in there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next time we&amp;rsquo;ll be in Cardiff will be for Christmas. Then it&amp;rsquo;ll only be another 4 months and I&amp;rsquo;ll be graduating. Getting nervous now it&amp;rsquo;s all going to be over so soon! We are both already looking forward to getting back to Wales and seeing everyone again.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As you can see they&amp;rsquo;re all still alive and growing :) I thinned the basil and parsley down quite a lot, I felt bad doing it but they were so overcrowded (the parsley&amp;rsquo;s still a bit wild). The parsley was pretty difficult as it&amp;rsquo;s become quite tangled but I managed to thin out about half of the seedlings. And now they are all starting to grow their second set of &amp;rsquo;true leaves'.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m off down to Cardiff tomorrow morning for the next two weeks, yay! I hope the herbs don&amp;rsquo;t all die by the time I get back though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

I make pancakes most Saturdays and felt like something different this weekend. That&amp;rsquo;s when I found &lt;a href="http://velvetlava.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/i-am-now-in-muffin-loop.html" target="_blank">this recipe&lt;/a> via pinterest, and they sounded so good especially as me and Jon both love cinnamon (I wish we had a Cinnabon in Edinburgh).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These muffins are AMAZING. Like melt-in-your-mouth sugary deliciousness. They&amp;rsquo;re like doughnut holes and would go down very nicely with a hot cup of coffee. Just don&amp;rsquo;t eat too many at once, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of sugar in there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/muffins.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1157" title="muffins" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/muffins.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="364" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are so simple to make too [&lt;a href="http://velvetlava.blogspot.co.uk/2009/02/i-am-now-in-muffin-loop.html" target="_blank">Here&amp;rsquo;s the recipe again in case you missed it&lt;/a>]. I had all of the ingredients (minus nutmeg which I replaced with a teeny bit more cinnamon) in my cupboard. I think I would only make half of the coating next time, I still have loads left over which I&amp;rsquo;ll save for whenever I want to use cinnamon sugar instead of regular. I also made 4 in cases and just dipped the top in, just so I can store them easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how they looked after they came out of the oven before I coated them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/beforesugar.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1158" title="beforesugar" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/beforesugar.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="314" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And here they are in all of their sugary-goodness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/muffins2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1159" title="muffins2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/muffins2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1014" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have to make these muffins. Seriously. &lt;em>Do it right now.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Firstly I wanted to show how thick this scrapbook has become. I&amp;rsquo;ve been changing things (like re-making pockets out of thinner paper) to make it a bit thinner as it has struggled to close, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty impressed by how much has fitted into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/thickness.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1149" title="thickness" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/thickness.jpg" width="490" height="613" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve gone back to the beggining of the book to add a couple pages on the planning stages of the trip, just a few pages cut out of the moleskine I was using to plan, some snaps of things like our &amp;lsquo;important items to be packed&amp;rsquo; and a map of our planned route.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/plans.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1150" title="plans" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/plans.jpg" width="490" height="485" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve added journalling to roughly a quarter of the pages so still have a lot more to do with that. I&amp;rsquo;ve realised now that I should&amp;rsquo;ve just printed off the blog posts and stuck those in within the pages, but hey that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt and that&amp;rsquo;s what I would do in the future. For now I shall continue with it, the journalling spots aren&amp;rsquo;t big ones they&amp;rsquo;re just little snippets of what we did on that day so hopefully won&amp;rsquo;t take too much longer to complete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did want to include the&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/category/usa-road-trip/" target="_blank"> blog posts&lt;/a> in the book, so I just put together the pages on Photoshop Elements and printed them on card and stuck them in at the back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/blogprints.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151" title="blogprints" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/blogprints.jpg" width="490" height="588" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are still a few pages at the very back where I&amp;rsquo;ll probably stick in something to hold stuff I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put in the book, and a  DVD of all our photos and our roadtrip playlist. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to finish it up and to move on to my next project&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s around 45min drive from Edinburgh and you can either go the coastal way or the city by-pass way (or there&amp;rsquo;s also a bus). Obviously the best is the coastal way which is 10miles less, and takes you all along the coast through little coastal villages - cute! Jon enjoys driving this road too and we totally recommend it. We&amp;rsquo;ve driven along it many times and found lots of nice beaches along the way, in particular the one we returned to today at Gullane.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We lazed on the sand, had a picnic, read our books, freezed our toes in the sea, went for a walk, and lazed some more. I am in need of a tan, my skin is so pale! I tried out my free sample of Hawaiian Tropic Sunscreen and it&amp;rsquo;s nice and moisturising and smells really good. I dreamt I was in Hawaii&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Woah they&amp;rsquo;re growing quick! Especially the parsley, since &lt;a title="Seedlings" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/seedlings/">last week&lt;/a> there were only 3 measly seedlings there. The basil is starting to grow it&amp;rsquo;s first &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; leaves, which means I&amp;rsquo;ll have to thin them out soon - I&amp;rsquo;m scared it&amp;rsquo;ll result in them all dying though. Not really sure what to do with the chives either, any ideas? Tempted to just leave them grow but I don&amp;rsquo;t want them to kill each other?! Hmm we&amp;rsquo;ll see how they do for now!&lt;/p>

Oh we&amp;rsquo;d love to live somewhere that is sunny all the time&amp;hellip; Today we went for a little drive around Holyrood Park, along Queen&amp;rsquo;s Drive. It&amp;rsquo;s a great one-way road with views across the sea to East Lothian and across Edinburgh itself. There are pull outs along the road and we stopped off at Dunsapie Loch. If you&amp;rsquo;re walking up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat this is probably the best place to park up and walk if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the shortest/easiest route up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/holyrooddrive.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1124" title="holyrooddrive" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/holyrooddrive.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1348" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[BTW my camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t like the sun much]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a walk about, watched the swans and people passing by. We noticed the same cyclist go by us 4 times in a short space of time, and the loop is 3.3miles up and down, go him!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I&amp;rsquo;m home I think I shall make some &lt;a title="Philly with Cadbury Chocolate Cheesecakes" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/philly-with-cadbury-chocolate-cheesecakes/">cadbury philly cheesecakes&lt;/a> (as requested by Jon), watch some TV and think about what to do this week.

I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go here for a while and the weather today made it an ideal time to go. Plus it&amp;rsquo;s amazingly free of charge, you only have to pay to go in the glasshouses, and there&amp;rsquo;s free parking on the weekends/evenings (or plenty of buses).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We only planned on stopping by for an hour, but ended up staying for longer, although we still only saw around a third of the gardens. We walked through the Chinese Hillside, Rock Garden and Herbaceous Border. There was a wedding reception at the Caledonian Hall opposite the Rock Garden and it looked beautiful, this was probably my favourite garden. There are views of Carlton Hill and Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat here, as well as a waterfall and of course lots of pretty flowers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/rbge.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1117" title="rbge" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/rbge.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1635" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind the Herbaceous Border is a huge beech hedge, we walked through it to these little gardens where fruit and vegetables were growing. There were rows for local primary schools to grow their own too which was cute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It felt like we were somewhere else, it was so peaceful and spacious yet so close to town. I could spend hours wandering around and lazing on the grass. We shall definitely be making future trips here and next time we&amp;rsquo;ll bring a picnic with us, or maybe indulge in an afternoon tea. Even if the weather&amp;rsquo;s bad we could pay to have a wander around the glasshouses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Totally recommend this place if you&amp;rsquo;re in Edinburgh!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yay! Some little seedlings have appeared a week after planting my &lt;a title="Grow Your Own Herbs" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/grow-your-own-herbs/">Gardener&amp;rsquo;s World Seeds&lt;/a>. The basil came up first and can already see I&amp;rsquo;ll have to do quite a bit of thinning with those. Only 3 of my parsley seeds have sprouted, but that&amp;rsquo;s better than none! The chives were the slowest to sprout, but now there are quite a few seedlings and they&amp;rsquo;re growing up fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll all keep on growing now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We bought a Ford Puma, mainly for its reliability, and got this one in particular because it was a good deal and had good history and all that stuff. We bought a return train ticket and we were both so nervous, but ended up returning with the car! Exciting times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We drove back and stopped off at &lt;a href="http://www.pentlandhills.org/" target="_blank">Pentland Hills Regional Park&lt;/a> for a little walk by Threipmuir Reservoir whilst the sun popped out of the rain clouds. This is why we chose to buy a car, to make little trips like this that make us smile.&lt;/p>

So today my BBC Gardeners&amp;rsquo; World Herb Kit arrived. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to grow herbs on our windowsill for a while now, and getting the free voucher meant I could purchase some!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/herbkit.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1085" title="herbkit" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/herbkit.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="205" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kit comes with Chive, Parsley and Basil seeds, compost, tray and these cool pots that you can write on with chalk. I sowed the seeds today and hopefully they will grow so we can use them. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p>

I think I only have like 2 more pages to do before I go back and tidy up some of the earlier pages, add a few simple pages to the beginning and ends (I&amp;rsquo;m going to print out the blog posts we wrote whilst on the road and stick them in at the end), then finally get round to journalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the pages I finished today, it looks pretty cluttered but I think looking at the pages as a whole it&amp;rsquo;s not so crazy. Although these couple of days in LA were rather hectic!&lt;/p>

Things slowed down recently as I was doing lots of overtime at work and I felt a couple of photos were missing from my stash to use in the book. But now work has calmed down and my awesome mum gave me an awesome printer so I can get going with it some more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I finished up 3 pages, all of our journey along the Pacific Coast. I cut one of the pages into a semi-circle so all these pages &amp;lsquo;fit in&amp;rsquo; together.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to finish it and start journalling and sharing it with you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today it was (partially) sunny outside and whilst scrapbooking I watched the birds, ate some flapjack that I made last night and drank cups of tea. I love this project!&lt;/p>

The reason for this is because we felt like we hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually been &lt;em>doing&lt;/em> much, just kinda hanging about waiting for September to roll around, and so we&amp;rsquo;d have something to look forward to doing each week. I said we should both write down 4 things we&amp;rsquo;d like to do and then show each other to see what we come up with. And so we did, and it turned out that we both had the exact same things down. Perfect! We set a &lt;em>maximum&lt;/em> budget of £25 for each date, as Jon&amp;rsquo;s started to make some money on the side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here&amp;rsquo;s our 4 things:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/IMGP0129.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1065" title="fourthings" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/IMGP0129.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="285" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are both excited about doing stuff together and finding new places to go. We may only be in Edinburgh for one more year so it&amp;rsquo;s about time we started seeing it and going to the places we&amp;rsquo;ve passed by where we&amp;rsquo;d say &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;d love to go there one day&amp;rsquo;. We have short-term things to look forward to and things to work for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to document our date nights/days in a mini book, with photos and bits and pieces like cinema tickets for example. I found &lt;a href="http://www.iloveitallwithmonikawright.com/2011/03/date-night.html" target="_blank">this date night mini book&lt;/a> created by Monica Wright which looks awesome and is the kind of thing I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to achieve, some great ideas there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll just be collecting bits and getting photos together first before I start putting the book together, as I&amp;rsquo;ll need to buy some little bits like cardstock and book rings etc. Once I get started on it I&amp;rsquo;ll put up a blog post. We started our 4 things last night with a meal at &lt;a href="http://www.gustorestaurants.uk.com/restaurants/gusto-edinburgh" target="_blank">Gusto&lt;/a> which was lush, and we are excited about next week!&lt;/p>

I ordered everything online except my jacket, and it all came within 3 days!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First up here&amp;rsquo;s my &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com" target="_blank">Topshop&lt;/a> haul. It all came to £45.40 incl the £4 delivery. I managed to get student discount, and the 10% even came off sale items! So those jeans only cost me £9 :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/topshop.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044" title="topshophaul" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/topshop.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="370" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Clockwise from left: &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4379980&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=02A29BCAM&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">MOTO HIGH WAISTED KRISTEN&lt;/a> // &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=1903240&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=42V30XSAL&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">SALMON BALLET PUMPS&lt;/a> // &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4920043&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=09M07AWHT&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">COTTON LYCRA TUNIC&lt;/a> // &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4738874&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=27M02APLE&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">FLORAL SKIRT&lt;/a> // &lt;a title="Nails in Pool Party" href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=2412181&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=20N01ZAQA&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">NAILS IN POOL PARTY&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;em>&lt;/em>I am pleased with everything. My favourite thing has to be the jeans, they fit really well. I blogged already about the nail polish &lt;a title="Nails in Pool Party" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/nails-in-pool-party/" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">After browsing Topshop I had to check out the &lt;a href="http://www.asos.com/" target="_blank">ASOS&lt;/a> sale. Lots of bargains to be found there! Unfortunately lots of things I wanted weren't available in my size. But I managed to get these jeans in indigo, and they fit perfectly, another great price. ASOS also offers free delivery and student discount (but not on sale items) too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/asos.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1048 aligncenter" title="asos" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/asos.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="369" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://www.asos.com//Vero-Moda/Vero-Moda-Skinny-Jeans/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=1653927" target="_blank">&lt;em>VERO MODA SKINNY JEANS&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Finally, after work I popped in to some shops looking for a jacket. I managed to pick one up at &lt;a href="http://www.zara.com" target="_blank">Zara&lt;/a>. It wasn't on sale but I really liked it and it feels like it'll last. Plus I needed one as I only really have a winter coat at the moment and seeing as it's July I could really do with something a bit lighter. It cost me £40, eek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately I can't seem to find it online, so here's a pic I took of my shopping haul with the jacket included!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/IMGP3245-2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1050" title="shopping" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/IMGP3245-2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="308" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
So that's how I managed to spend most of my money... Have you picked out anything in the summer sales?

You can book up to 6 tickets in one go and are first-come first-served across all of the Vue cinemas. You don't have to stay in the cinema the whole time or arrive at the start, as you can re-enter as many times as you like. So if there's just one event you wanted to see then it's ideal. I think it'd be pretty good to watch Usain Bolt on the big screen hopefully smashing another record!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;del>started to spend&lt;/del> spent all of the £100 that I won from Uni which I mentioned &lt;a title="Taste of Edinburgh Cancelled…" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/taste-of-edinburgh-cancelled/">here&lt;/a>. Something that I wanted to buy was a new nail varnish and I decided on &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=2412181&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;searchTerm=Pool&amp;amp;pageSize=20" target="_blank">this one&lt;/a> from Topshop in Pool Party. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely, bright and glossy turquoisey blue - great for summer! I only own pinks, reds and neutral nail polishes so it was good to get something totally different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I only put it on today so I can&amp;rsquo;t comment on how long it&amp;rsquo;ll last, although at work my nails chip &lt;em>a lot &lt;/em>so I&amp;rsquo;m not expecting too much, but it was nice and thick and feels good quality. In the photo I only have one coat on and no top coat so it&amp;rsquo;s not completely opaque. It&amp;rsquo;s my first Topshop nail varnish and I already want more, they have so many good colours! It cost £5 but as a student with 10% off it came down to £4.50 ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along with my new nail polish I bought lots of clothes. I rarely buy clothes, usually just after Christmas and my birthday, but when I do I tend to buy them all in one go.  I&amp;rsquo;m definitely more of a saver than a spender. I may post about what I bought tomorrow :D&lt;/p>

When it was on TV (over 2 years ago it finished!) me and Jon were both hooked. And I admit I was a bit overly hooked; I was on the forums speculating theories and all. I know sometimes it did go a bit crazy and there were so many questions to be answered, but it was the characters that I loved about it. It&amp;rsquo;s one of my favourite TV shows along with The Shield, and the reasons for both are because of the characters and how much I cared about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now we&amp;rsquo;ve just started to watch it all over again! I baked some cookies using my &lt;a title="Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/">go-to recipe&lt;/a>, and decided to quickly ice some of them with a Lost theme. Yep one had the numbers on, and another with the dharma logo. Too cool ha.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/lostcookie.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018" title="lostcookie" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/lostcookie.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were as yummy as ever, and we pretty much ate them all whilst watching 5 episodes of the show. Although I think we got through most of them in the first episode&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Were you a Lost fan? Love/Hate the ending?&lt;/p>

We woke up expecting to be going to the &lt;a href="http://www.tasteofedinburgh.co.uk/" target="_blank">Taste of Edinburgh&lt;/a> festival this evening and we were both really looking forward to it. With top restaurants in Edinburgh (incl The Balmoral, Tigerlily and Cucina) and top chefs (incl Fabulous Baking Brothers, Lloyd Grossman, Jason Atherton), it looked to be a great evening out trying out different meals and watching demonstrations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/tasteofedin.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996" title="tasteofedin" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/tasteofedin.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="153" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately we woke up to heavy rain. Overnight the meadows were flooded and we had a text from taste telling us it was cancelled. Wahh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we had some good, totally unrelated, news through the post. It was a letter from my university, which I thought would be the physical copy of my exam results. Instead it was a letter saying I had won an award for outstanding merit of the year along with a £100 cheque! This cheered me up, my hard work studying paid off, wahoo :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we thought we should celebrate and do something since the festival was cancelled. I was kept updated about taste on twitter. Quite a few of the restaurants had special offers for people with tickets which I thought was generous and nice of them. Then I found that &lt;a href="http://markgreenaway.com/live/home.html" target="_blank">Mark Greenaway&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.angelswithbagpipes.co.uk/" target="_blank">Angels with Bagpipes&lt;/a> set up a last minute free pop-up event at Summer Hall serving up their award-winning dishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So yeh we kinda had to go! We went along with Nat and Mike and after a drink and a walk we arrived at the end of a queue. After around 15mins the queue started moving and we were the second batch of people to get in. It felt strange walking in to what seemed like someone&amp;rsquo;s house and it was packed! It was part of Edinburgh Uni&amp;rsquo;s Vet School, so there were a lot of strange things like coloured bubbling cylinders by the bar and other random stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were quite confused with where we were meant to go with people jammed everywhere and being British we felt we had to be in a queue. After switching queues almost three times and nearly walking in to the kitchen we managed to get some scallops with pea puree which was lovely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After ending up outside at a seating area me and Nat decided to try again inside. This time we were a lot more strategic and managed to get desserts of Eton Mess and 2 mains -  11 hour slow roasted pork belly served with puffed crackling, pomme puree and toffee apple jus and a delicious leg of lamb dish. Delicious!!&lt;/p>
&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012" title="toe" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/toe.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1049" />
&lt;p>It was funny to watch people getting food, we felt a bit like seagulls when it came around. One guy had like 10 plates of scallops all to himself (not in one go mind)! There was so much food - I think I had 4 desserts, 2 mains and a starter. The dessert was definitely my favourite, think Jon liked the pomme puree (or mash to us lot) and pork the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a big thank you to everyone involved, especially to Mark Greenaway and Paul Whitecross for their yummy dishes! It&amp;rsquo;s such a shame about the festival being cancelled because of the rain, but we ended up having a great day after all.&lt;/p>

The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good but we wanted to get some fresh air and exercise after a very lazy weekend (think movies and lots of ice-cream). From our flat to the park it&amp;rsquo;s about 2.5miles through Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s old town. We had planned on walking up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat but the ground was quite slippery so skipped it this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988" title="holyrood" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1062" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead we walked along the Salisbury Crags and up to the base of Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat and around in a loop. There were quite a lot of people about, and a few runners covered in mud. We would like to live near here so we could go jogging around the park in the mornings, perhaps one day we will try and jog there and back from our flat (hmm just maybe).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh, it&amp;rsquo;s nice having such a big park so close to the city centre and with great views of the city. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of walks to do in the park, and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it to anyone visiting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989" title="holyrood2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="343" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully the weather will pick up soon, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe we are already in July.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I did some more baking, but this time I had to pop to the shop to pick up 2 lemons. I baked a lovely lemon drizzle cake. It&amp;rsquo;s my first attempt at this cake and I was happy with the result - although I think there was a bit too much mix in my loaf tin as it went HUGE, so next time I&amp;rsquo;ll either scale down the ingredients or do the loaf as well as some little cupcakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how it was made..&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/lemondrizzle.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976" title="lemondrizzle" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/lemondrizzle.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="785" />&lt;/a>&lt;em>225g unsalted butter//310g caster sugar//4 eggs//2 lemons//225g self-raising flour&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
Here is the recipe I followed via &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4942/lemon-drizzle-cake">BBC Good Food&lt;/a> &lt;em>(my changes in bold)&lt;/em>:
&lt;blockquote>Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Beat together 225g softened unsalted butter and 225g caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add 4 eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through. Sift in 225g flour, then add the finely grated zest of &lt;strong>1.5 lemons&lt;/strong> and mix until well combined. Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.
&lt;p>Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the juice of &lt;strong>2 lemons&lt;/strong> and 85g caster sugar to make the drizzle. Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle - the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping. Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.&lt;/blockquote>
The cake was lovely and moist, but the top was definitely the best part ;)&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/freckledfawn.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-949 aligncenter" title="freckledfawn" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/freckledfawn.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="336" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
Woo!! I treated myself to some lovely washi tape from &lt;a href="http://freckledfawn.com/" target="_blank">Freckled Fawn&lt;/a>. I couldn't resist since it's just been my first payday, and also because readers of &lt;a href="http://aliedwards.com/blog" target="_blank">Ali Edwards' blog&lt;/a> were offered free shipping. Perfect timing!
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve browsed Freckled Fawn many times, thinking as it&amp;rsquo;s American and priced in $ the shipping would be expensive. So I went ahead and chose the above three products, coming to $10.05 - paypal charging me £6.66, a great price for these items especially since they are coming all the way from the US. I later found that the shipping would have only cost me $2.30, very reasonable so this would no longer discourage me from buying from over there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have wanted to purchase washi tape for a while now, it&amp;rsquo;s so pretty with lots of uses. Here are (some of) my top picks from Freckled Fawn.&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I am so excited for it to arrive, I have a feeling I will become addicted though; there are so many cute patterns and colours!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Do you own any washi tape? What sort of things do you use it for?&lt;/p>

And here&amp;rsquo;s what I ended up with&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/souffle.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906" title="souffle" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/souffle.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="734" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;chocolate soufflés!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4351/chocolate-souffls" target="_blank">this recipe&lt;/a> from BBC GoodFood, but used 1/3 of the ingredients to serve 2. I used &lt;a href="http://www.greenandblacks.com/uk/what-we-make/bars/cherry.html" target="_blank">Green &amp;amp; Black&amp;rsquo;s Cherry chocolate&lt;/a> (still leftover from Christmas!). The mixture filled both of my ramekins right to the top, and so I filled a silicone cupcake case up with the leftovers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After cooking for around 15mins, they were nice and firm on top but lovely and gooey in the middle! They tasted really good, and it was nice with the pieces of cherries from the chocolate. I think the ones in the ramekins were a bit too much, but the cupcake size was just right!&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel like yesterday was the beginning of summer. I&amp;rsquo;m not enjoying spending so much time in the flat, especially as I made some calculations and figured we couldn&amp;rsquo;t spend any money until the end of July (next payday) for us to afford rent over summer. So we shall have to start making money other ways and doing as much free stuff to keep us entertained!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we went to Union Canal in Fountainbridge with some leftover crusts of bread. We were soaked by the time we returned home but it feels good once in a while to get out in the rain and not care about being wet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887" title="feedducks" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="531" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny moment when Jon threw some bread, we heard a thump and a pigeon fly right across us, he accidentally hit the poor thing! We felt like kids feeding the ducks, and think we shall go and feed them each time we have old stale bread instead of throwing it in the bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been doing with all these rainy days?&lt;/p>

Even more so now I have a mini stapler. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rexel-BAMBI-STPLR-1-5M-STPL/dp/B000SHSK9S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1340039737&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">This Bambi one&lt;/a> to be precise. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how excited I get about little things like finally owning a stapler - thanks Jon for encouraging me to get it haha. It&amp;rsquo;s so cute though! But anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s my scrapbook peek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapsanfran.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878" title="scrapsanfran" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapsanfran.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1063" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting the hang of making my pockets to hold stuff sturdily, again by cutting a page in half. I even painted this one &lt;em>and&lt;/em> cut a rectangle out to show the Alcatraz logo-image-thingy and stuck some acetate film in its place, fancy ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still on San Francisco and have a couple of pages still to do here, then only around 5days of the trip left to go before I will get journalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>{Scrapbook peeks are little glimpses of the scrapbook I’ve been putting together of a road trip in the US from last summer. Here are my previous peeks: &lt;a title="A Chilled Out Weekend" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/a-chilled-out-weekend/">#1&lt;/a>, &lt;a title="Scrapbook Peek #2" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/scrapbook-peek-2/">#2&lt;/a>,&lt;a title="Life Lately" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/life-lately/">#3&lt;/a>, &lt;a title="Scrapbook Peek #4" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/scrapbook-peek-4/" target="_blank">#4&lt;/a>, &lt;a title="DIY: Sewn Map Art" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/diy-sewn-map-art/" target="_blank">#4.5&lt;/a>}&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DIY: Fabric Corner Bookmark</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/diy-fabric-corner-bookmark/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2012 16:52:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/diy-fabric-corner-bookmark/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;ve still got lots of &lt;a title="Free Fabric Samples" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/free-fabric-samples/">free fabric samples&lt;/a> to use and so I decided to make a little corner bookmark out of a piece of leather and soft wool. The edges of the samples are already cut in a zigzag so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d keep it that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/bookmark.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856" title="bookmark" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/bookmark.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="548" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the corners of a book I drew outlines of where to cut the material to get two triangles. Then I simply sewn the two pieces together along the edges to create a pocket. The leather sample is pretty thick and so it was quite hard getting the needle through but I got there in the end!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now I shall be using this bookmark on the book I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading. It&amp;rsquo;s nice and sturdy so it should stay in place fine with no worries of it slipping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have a lovely weekend!&lt;/p>

As I still haven&amp;rsquo;t learnt to drive, I&amp;rsquo;m usually the navigator. Road trips are one of mine and Jon&amp;rsquo;s top favourite things to do, being able to get in a car and drive wherever the road takes us and finding new places to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we first came to Edinburgh we spent a lot of time driving around the coast and planning little day trips. Unfortunately we no longer have a car in Edinburgh, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford it, and it&amp;rsquo;s something we miss a lot to be able to just go for a drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst road tripping in the US, we had &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rand-McNally-Road-Atlas-United/dp/0528003364/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1339592973&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">this great mapbook&lt;/a> in the car with us that I used to get us around. We did consider a GPS/using internet but thought a paper map won&amp;rsquo;t tell us to go the wrong way (that would be my responsibility..) and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about signal and having to spend extra money. The mapbook successfully didn&amp;rsquo;t get us lost whilst out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been looking up ways to display maps as artwork , and I found &lt;a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/375160/map-artwork" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> thanks to Martha Stewart (instructions in the link). This is a perfect way to display a road trip!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/map-frames.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845" title="map-frames" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/map-frames.jpg" width="490" height="306" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I&amp;rsquo;ll do a large map of the West of the US and sew on our road trip and frame it like above :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So yesterday I had a little play with a free map I picked up in San Francisco. I hand sewn on the route that we took of a day we spent sightseeing (&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/day-17-san-fran-sights/" target="_blank">this one&lt;/a>) and put an X where we began and ended - the San Remo Hotel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/sewn-map.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846" title="sewn map" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/sewn-map.jpg" width="490" height="551" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having completed this I&amp;rsquo;m eager to sew the big road trip next. I stuck this San Francisco map in to my scrapbook and I think it looks pretty good!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I decided to bake cupcakes. I had some time before going to my friend Claire&amp;rsquo;s flat so I quickly put them together. I went for 3 different flavours all with vanilla sponge - plain frosting, chocolate frosting, and a swirl of nutella.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make the sponge I followed &lt;a href="http://www.nigella.com/recipes/view/cupcakes-146" target="_blank">Nigella&amp;rsquo;s recipe&lt;/a>, with minor changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>125g self-raising flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>125g caster sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>125g soft unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Half a teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons milk&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Firstly, preheat the oven to 200C and line the tray with 12 cupcake cases.
&lt;p>In a bowl, cream together the sugar and butter (I melted half to make it easier). Add the vanilla extract and mix the eggs in one at a time. Then add the flour, a bit at a time, until there&amp;rsquo;s no lumps and add the milk if needed until it becomes a soft, dropping consistency. Finally spoon the mixture in to the cases so they are all roughly even.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the nutella cupcakes, at this stage I swirled in a spoonful of nutella in to the top of 4 cupcakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then place in to the oven for 15-20mins until golden. Mmm I love the smell that comes out of the kitchen during this part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the buttercream frostings, I put around 100g softened butter in a bowl and added icing sugar bit by bit until I was happy with the texture and taste. Make sure the butter is soft as it aches your arm if it&amp;rsquo;s not! I usually leave the oven door open after baking the cakes and it helps soften it up nicely. I spreaded half of the frosting on to 4 cupcakes, and the rest I mixed with cocoa powder to make 4 chocolate cupcakes. Then decorate with whatever sprinkles you have - I used gold stars and purple shimmer sugar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Delicious! I think I&amp;rsquo;ll try doing 3 different types each time I bake them so I can try out lots of new flavours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/cutcupcake.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-831" title="cutcupcake" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/cutcupcake.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

(And I had an 8-letter word but no R on the board - typical!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrabble.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816" title="scrabble" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrabble.jpg" width="490" height="183" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve made some more progress with my travel scrapbook too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapbook-4.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823" title="scrapbook 4" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapbook-4.jpg" width="490" height="720" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m finally on to &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm" target="_blank">Yosemite NP&lt;/a>, such amazing scenery there we both loved it, a definite must-see if in CA!! I have a lot of pics to fill the next few pages with, and this time I cut one of the pages in half to put the envelope on that holds the leaflets, etc in and it&amp;rsquo;s much sturdier that way (other side shown in the bottom pic painted purple). Wish I did this from the start!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what things do you like to do on a rainy day?&lt;/p>

So today after work I was walking back through town and decided to stop off at Boots on Princes St and found loads of them on the shelves. I managed to pick up 2 different ones and then stopped at a corner shop to get the third to complete the collection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/glamour-benefit.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-794" title="glamour benefit" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/glamour-benefit.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="651" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The magazine itself costs £2 and the free Benefit gifts are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.benefitcosmetics.co.uk/product/view/that-gal" target="_blank">"that gal"&lt;/a> brightening face primer (7.5ml worth £15)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.benefitcosmetics.co.uk/product/view/the-porefessional" target="_blank">the POREfessional&lt;/a> PRO balm to minimise the appearance of pores (7.5ml worth £10)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.benefitcosmetics.co.uk/product/view/badgal-lash-mascara" target="_blank">BADgal lash&lt;/a> mascara (4g worth £10)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
I'm looking forward to trying them out as I've only tried the mascara which I really like, and have heard great things about the others. Hopefully they'll last as long as Glamour's previous Benefit freebies that I've bought! I still have a bit of my full-sized It Stick concealer (now discontinued), eye bright pencil and BADgal eyeliner (unopened yet as I'm still using one I bought).
&lt;p>As for the extra magazines I now have, don&amp;rsquo;t worry they won&amp;rsquo;t be thrown in the bin. I have lots of ideas to use them for incl this &lt;a title="Time For a Catch Up" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/catch-up-time/">mirror frame&lt;/a> ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Glamour give away Benefit products each year, and I think for £2 it&amp;rsquo;s a bargain. Have you tried these products? What do you think of them?&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished making these cookies and they are soo good! I&amp;rsquo;ve only made cookies a couple of times before and usually am disappointed. So this time I searched on blogs looking for a Millie&amp;rsquo;s Cookie style cookie (yummy) and stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://laureneasmith.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/millies-cookie-recipe.html" target="_blank">this&lt;/a>. And I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These cookies are amazing, crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle - just how I like them. Jon gave them a definite thumbs up too, and so this will be my go-to recipe for cookies now. I went for simple milk choc chip cookies using a bar of dairy milk and a flake. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to experiment with different flavours in the future!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here&amp;rsquo;s how they were made, thanks to &lt;a href="http://laureneasmith.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/millies-cookie-recipe.html" target="_blank">this blog&lt;/a> which I adapted a little as I went.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/baking-cookies1.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-782" title="baking cookies1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/baking-cookies1.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1467" />&lt;/a>&lt;em>125g butter, softened//100g light brown soft sugar//125g caster sugar//1 egg//1 tsp vanilla extract//225g self-raising flour//½ tsp salt//1 small bar dairy milk and 1 flake&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Firstly preheat the oven to 180°C, gas mark 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">1. Put the brown and caster sugar in a bowl and cream together with the butter (I melted half of it to speed up the process)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">2. Combine with the egg and the vanilla extract&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">3. Add the flour and salt and mix it all together so it becomes doughy&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">4. Chop up the dairy milk and crumble the flake and mix everything together&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Finally roll the dough into a big sausage shape and cut it into 20 pieces and place on 2 trays lined with baking paper. As I didn't have large enough baking trays I could only fit 14 cookies on so with the rest I made one big cookie in a round cake tin. They go in the oven for 7mins, although they may not look cooked they should be so take them out to cool. The outside should stiffen and crisp as they cool. Or you can cook them for a bit longer if you prefer! (For me 8mins was perfect with my oven and preference)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">And enjoy! I sure did ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP3004.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" title="IMGP3004" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP3004.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="151" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I think the big cookie would be great iced as a birthday cookie, just like at Millie's cookies!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As shown in the photo above I do go a bit crazy for free stuff from time to time. If I see a good sample I want to try then I will end up searching for more and get as many as I can in one big go. So recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been going sample hunting and trying to find some good ones. Here are my latest goodies:&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2969.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-771" title="latest samples" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2969.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="344" />&lt;/a>&lt;em>Diesel Only The Brave Tattoo//L'Oreal Men Expert Hydra Energetic//Herbal Essences Hello Hydration//Garnier BB Cream//L'Oreal Youth Code Luminize&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">So far I've only tried the &lt;a href="https://secure.garnier.co.uk/_en/_gb/BB-cream/" target="_blank">Garnier BB Cream&lt;/a> and I think it's awesome. It's good having so much in one cream, incl SPF 15 so I was sorted with that for the sunny days. Jon is using the &lt;a href="http://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/skincare/hydra-energetic/daily-moisturising-lotion.aspx" target="_blank">L'Oreal Hydra Energetic Moisturiser &lt;/a>and really likes it, and it smells good too.&lt;/p>
Here are some samples I've collected together that are currently available to grab:

So me and Jon spent our time on Saturday at Gullane beach and Sunday at the meadows with friends and barbecues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/barbecues.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-734" title="barbecues" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/barbecues.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="925" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this weather lasts, the sun just seems to put everyone in a happy mood. I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You&lt;/a> and so far loving it, I don&amp;rsquo;t want it to end!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beach at Gullane is nice, and luckily our friends have a car so we could get down there easily. From Edinburgh there is a First bus that does go there and other beaches too - the no. 124 I think. Here&amp;rsquo;s a cute pic of Natalie and Mike at the beach :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2957.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-736" title="gullane beach" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2957.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope y&amp;rsquo;all are enjoying the weather too!&lt;/p>

By following these simple instructions &lt;a href="http://www.wholeliving.com/133668/read-wrap-recycle-make-bows-magazines" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>, I was able to make a bow out of one magazine page. By using the instructions which tell you how big strips to cut etc you can make a bow to add an extra touch to a gift. I just wrapped his presents in brown paper and stuck this on top!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pretty cute :) I was quite rushed doing this and the loops should be tighter, but I doubt my boyfriend would even notice!&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Edinburgh for nearly 3 years and still hadn&amp;rsquo;t been across there even though it&amp;rsquo;s so close. Jon had lots of bday cash to spend so Glasgow was a great choice with so many shops!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP29181.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-718" title="Glasgow trip" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP29181.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="2369" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
We got the &lt;a href="http://www.citylink.co.uk/index.php" target="_blank">citylink&lt;/a> bus from Haymarket to Glasgow which only cost us £6 return with 20% student discount online and took around an hour. Such good timing when we went as the sun was out the whole time.
&lt;p>Jon bought a few things, pretty much everything from H&amp;amp;M - I think we went to 4 different ones and multiple times too. I think he likes it there ha. I used my &lt;a href="http://dwell.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dwell&lt;/a> free £20 voucher and chose a cookie type jar for the kitchen, it has a dog&amp;rsquo;s head on the lid! Struggled a bit to find the shop, it was in the lovely Princes Square, but glad we found it in the end. We did a lot of walking around shops so it was nice stopping for a sitdown and drink - we both loved the passion burst drink at the Fuel Juice Bar - so refreshing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had dinner at T.G.I&amp;rsquo;s and used our &lt;a title="Free(ish) T.G.I Friday’s Juicy Burger" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/freeish-t-g-i-fridays-juicy-burger/" target="_blank">free burger vouchers&lt;/a>, so yummy!! I had the BBQ Smokehouse and Jon had the Monster Burger. We only paid for drinks and dessert, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten that much in a long time, we struggled to walk back to the hotel&amp;hellip; So worth it though!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stayed overnight at the &lt;a href="http://www.citizenm.com/glasgow/" target="_blank">citizenM hotel&lt;/a>, which was really nice and we had fun playing around with the remote that controls everything in the room, including the shower pod colour. Such a big comfy bed too we didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna get up in the morning!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We didn&amp;rsquo;t see much of Glasgow with such short time, but what we did see was great. We&amp;rsquo;d both like to go back and see some more :D&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The sun is shining and things are good. I start a new job tomorrow, Jon is busy making business plans and it&amp;rsquo;s his birthday on Thursday. We are going shopping, eating and drinking in Glasgow (we&amp;rsquo;ve both never been before) and staying the night in a fab hotel. I wish birthdays came more often!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.tgifridays.co.uk/" target="_blank">T.G.I. Friday&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> are giving away free burgers when you buy any drink via the following link:&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
To win a burger you have to play the game 'Juicy Splatdown' and finish level 3. It's a whack-a-mole style game, and once you complete round 3 you will either win a burger or be told to try again.
&lt;p>I managed to get a voucher on my second attempt and most people seem to get them on their first couple attempts too. If someone else in your house wants one then I think it may be difficult to get another unless you change your ip, perhaps by tethering with your mobile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be emailed a voucher to print off and bring with you to T.G.I&amp;rsquo;s, then you just have to buy a drink and you can choose a burger from their range. See below for terms and conditions (or via the &lt;a href="http://games.tgifridays.co.uk/juicysplatdown/terms/" target="_blank">website&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Aside from the bad weather (it&amp;rsquo;s Britain after all) I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying not having to revise anymore and having time to catch up on tv, etc. This currently consists of HIMYM (ah season finale :o), Gossip Girl (another season finale!), Glee (yes I&amp;rsquo;m a fan), Game of Thrones (crazy), and I&amp;rsquo;ve started rewatching The Shield (watch it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also been busy with my scrapbook and managed to complete 3 pages yesterday. Any guesses at to where these photos were taken? ;) My &lt;strong>scrapbook peek #3&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>

With a whole load of accessories included - Yipee!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-deluxe-kit.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-647" title="diana deluxe kit" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-deluxe-kit.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="390" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at toy cameras for a while now. I like that they are plastic, light and use film. I particularly love the Diana F+ from Lomography, I love the outcome of the photos and not knowing how they&amp;rsquo;ll come out until the film is developed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Me and Jon split the cost between us because we both wanted it so bad and for £50 each it&amp;rsquo;s a great deal. Luckily Jon worked his eBay magic and managed to get us the &lt;a href="http://microsites.lomography.com/diana/accessories/diana-deluxe-kit" target="_blank">Diana Deluxe Kit &lt;/a>for just £100 incl. p&amp;amp;p.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the main features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Diana F+&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diana Flash&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hot shoe adaptors (one for camera, one for flash)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cable Release Collar and cable release&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Splitzer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diana 35mm Back + 4 masks for 4 formats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diana F+ 20mm Fisheye Lens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diana F+ 38mm Super-Wide Lens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diana F+ 55mm Wide-Angle Lens + Close-Up Lens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diana F+ 110mm Telephoto Lens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Viewfinder Adaptor&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Universal Viewfinder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fisheye Viewfinder&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
There's also little things like lens covers, drawstring bags for all the lenses, a book, etc thrown in too! Well the box arrived today and woah that's a whole load of stuff!!
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-f+.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-651" title="diana f+" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-f+.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="698" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately I don&amp;rsquo;t have any film yet so haven&amp;rsquo;t had a play, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got to admire all the parts and work out how everything works. We&amp;rsquo;re gonna try 35mm film first as it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper and more available, then when we&amp;rsquo;ve more experience we&amp;rsquo;ll try the 120mm. I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to get snapping and try out lots of different things, although I&amp;rsquo;m sure the first roll of film we have developed will be terrible but I&amp;rsquo;d enjoy it all the same!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With all these bits there&amp;rsquo;s nothing more I could want from this camera :D Jon&amp;rsquo;s most excited to use the Fisheye and I just can&amp;rsquo;t wait for everything, just wanna get outside now! Although there is something I shall add to my wishlist&amp;hellip; the &lt;a href="http://microsites.lomography.com/diana/accessories/diana-instant-back" target="_blank">Instant back&lt;/a> so it can be used like a polaroid - amazing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what d&amp;rsquo;ya think of my new toy? Do you have a toy camera or thinking of getting one?&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;m almost halfway through the trip and I&amp;rsquo;ve loved making it and reminding myself of all the good memories we had there. I&amp;rsquo;ve not done any journalling in it yet as I still don&amp;rsquo;t have an acid free pen, but I think once all the pics and bits are in then I&amp;rsquo;ll go through and fill in all the blanks! It&amp;rsquo;ll be so great to look through in the future.&lt;/p>

I wanna have lots of different coloured and sized ones to put sweets, crisps, dip, popcorn and anything in. I love watching movies with a load of them filled with a selection of stuff that I can pick and choose from. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just that I&amp;rsquo;m lazy and like to eat sweets - it&amp;rsquo;s easier to get to them when they&amp;rsquo;re not in a packet. But I could say it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;portion control&amp;rsquo; instead ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sadly my cupboards in the kitchen are teeny so I can only have a couple, but I enjoy window shopping for bowls almost as much as owning them. Is that weird?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few of my current favourites a long with some cute bento boxes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: right;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/bowls-and-bento-boxes.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-576 aligncenter" title="bowls and bento boxes" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/bowls-and-bento-boxes.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1162" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">[/ordered_list]&lt;/p>
As well as bowls, I want to own a Bento box. I think they are so cool with compartments and stuff and not clunky like lunch boxes which hardly fit in my bag. I especially like the Aladdin one seen above as it's fully sealable and can store both hot or cold food and keep it that way. Although i'd get the smaller size, this one can be for Jon! I don't enjoy lunch at uni because it's normally a squashed sandwich, but with a bento box I think I'd experiment a lot more and take pasta, couscous etc with me - so much better!
&lt;p>So anyone else like me that loves bowls? Or maybe its spoons or dessert plates? (Both of which I love btw)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday we both volunteered at the &lt;a title="Rock ‘n’ Roll Edinburgh Half Marathon" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/rock-n-roll-edinburgh-half-marathon/">Rock &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; Roll Edinburgh Half Marathon&lt;/a>, which was really fun and it was such a nice sunny day. We were over at Holyrood park all morning and after holding rope for the corral starts we ate hotdogs before the runners started to come through the finish line with the female winner after 1hr 16mins! We were working at the chip retrieval where we clipped the chips off people shoes, yum. Was a great day, maybe some time we&amp;rsquo;ll be running it :p&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards we went to Usher Hall to see &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lwxj1/features/banglive" target="_blank">Bang Goes the Theory Live&lt;/a> (not to be confused with the Big Bang Theory)! We managed to get free tickets and it was pretty good. Lots of kids though and I was sat by a boy who couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop jumping up and down in his seat so I was flinging around lol, that was quite annoying after a while&amp;hellip; Was an entertaining show though for all the family and educational too, and the audience were involved which the kids loved. It was my first time inside Usher Hall and it&amp;rsquo;s a really nice venue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Monday - Wednesday Jon had family up to visit which was lovely. It&amp;rsquo;s so good when we have visitors, sucks we are so far away! They were staying in an amazing apartment right in town with heated floors which were so nice and even a garden. Hate how cold our flat is :( There was this mirror in the lounge which I love:&lt;/p>
&lt;img class="aligncenter" title="mirror" src="http://media-cache2.pinterest.com/upload/26529085275208448_hmRtjSl6_f.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="309" />
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s made of magazine pages rolled up in to squares. So I had a look at how to make it and found lots of other things to make with magazine paper which &lt;a href="http://pinterest.com/sarahls12/craft-ideas/" target="_blank">I pinned on Pinterest&lt;/a> (so addictive!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before Jon&amp;rsquo;s family had to leave back to Cardiff we had free cocktails at the &lt;a href="http://www.therutlandhotel.com/bar-rutland-hotel-2.htm" target="_blank">Rutland Hotel Bar&lt;/a> :D They were so good - in order of yummiest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>42 Ways to Leave Your Lover&lt;/strong> &lt;em>- 42 Below Kiwi, Cointreau, mango juice, citrus and basil combine for a long cool thirst quencher.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lemon and Lychee Caipiroska&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>Sharp and tangy with a hint of tropical sweetness, Absolut Citron and lychee juice combine for an exciting twist on a classic.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Crimson Kisses&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>A romantic blend of fresh raspberries, Bombay Sapphire, rose liqueur &amp;amp; sparkling rose wine.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Rutland Mai-Ta&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>Classic Mai-Tai recipe made with our Rutland rum blend, fresh lime and Grand Marnier.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Would definitely go back there for more!
&lt;p>We also had a wander around the shops, and went to &lt;a href="http://www.anthropologie.eu/" target="_blank">Anthropologie&lt;/a> which I&amp;rsquo;d never been to before but Jon&amp;rsquo;s parents had been whilst in the US. It&amp;rsquo;s such a nice shop, pretty expensive, but they had a sale! Jon&amp;rsquo;s Mum found this plate and we had to get it, down to £3 from £12:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/purple-plate.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-554" title="purple plate" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/purple-plate.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="630" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now they&amp;rsquo;ve gone back we are sad they&amp;rsquo;ve gone and we have to get back to studying. Revision plan has kicked back in and my first exam is this Tuesday&amp;hellip; :/ Starting to stress but thing like tea, cake and highlighters make it all a bit better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/uni-work.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-555" title="uni work" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/uni-work.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s my week so far. The rest will be a nice evening tonight then stuck at my desk trying to get all this revision in to my head. I shall be sleeping with symbols in my dreams.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A couple of days ago I had a bit of time spare so painted my nails. I used Max Factor&amp;rsquo;s nailfinity in Red Passion that I had for my bday. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely vibrant red. I used the nail art pen again that I used &lt;a title="Chevron Nail Art" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chevron-nail-art/">here&lt;/a>, and painted on some dots. The pen&amp;rsquo;s great for doing polka dots, just make sure to put a clear coat of varnish on top or they might chip off. I think they look kinda ladybuggy/watermelony, nice and summery :)&lt;/p>

I usually use a flake on them too but I didn’t buy any so they’re a bit less chocolatey than normal, but still just as tasty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2724-2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528" title="IMGP2724 (2)" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2724-2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="346" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used my &lt;a title="New Icing Bag Set" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/tala-icing-bag-set/" target="_blank">Tala icing bag&lt;/a>, and tried out a different nozzle on the one cupcake – can you spot it? :p&lt;/p>

I really want to find some in the US, and managed to get a big list of ones I can apply for over there – so my weekend will consist of hours of applying to as many as possible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst I was looking I stumbled upon the &lt;a href="http://runrocknroll.competitor.com/" target="_blank">Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon Series&lt;/a>, a collection of running events across America known for lining routes with live bands, cheerleaders and themed water stations. This year it is being brought over to Europe with events in Edinburgh, Dublin, Madrid and Lisbon. Ooh Edinburgh!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/edin-rocknroll.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-518" title="edin rocknroll" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/edin-rocknroll.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="70" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I went on &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh" target="_blank">Rock ‘n’ Roll Edinburgh&lt;/a> and the 1/2 marathon is on the 15th April. I’m no way fit enough to take part, but they have &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh/volunteer" target="_blank">volunteering opportunities&lt;/a> so I signed up :) It looks like a fun event to be part of so am looking forward to it, you choose what shift you fancy doing with lots of choices of what exactly to do, and they need support from volunteers. And it’s all for &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh/charity" target="_blank">charity&lt;/a> of course!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>To register for the marathon: &lt;a href="http://uk.competitor.com/edinburgh/register" target="_blank">click here&lt;/a> (by 8/4/12)

&lt;p>A little while ago I stumbled upon the blog &lt;a href="http://witandwhistle.com/2012/01/16/diy-stencil-pillow/" target="_blank">Wit &amp;amp; Whistle&lt;/a> when I was looking for crafty ideas. I love cushions and was looking for a way I could customise one myself, and fell in love with this one, such a great idea! I had to make it as luckily the instructions sounded pretty straightforward. Click the link above for the detailed instructions, they&amp;rsquo;re really good!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only problem I had was deciding on what to actually put on the cushion. I wanted quite a long quote that would cover the entire cover, and there were so many I wanted. But I finally decided on &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/22842" target="_blank">this quote&lt;/a> - gotta love Dr Seuss! The supplies I used were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Plain Cushion Cover (Bought mine from H&amp;amp;M &lt;a href="http://www.hm.com/gb/product/83390?article=83390-E#article=83390-A" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Fabric Marker (Purchased from Amazon &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sharpie-Rub-a-Dub%C3%82%C2%AE-Laundry-Marker-Black/dp/B00387BTJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1333231606&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Stencil (Again from Amazon &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Helix-Lettering-Stencil-10mm-H40891/dp/B00290IYS4/ref=sr_1_2?s=officeproduct&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1333231651&amp;amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">here&lt;/a> - I used the 30mm one)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A pencil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some cardboard (for placing inside cover)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/diy-cushion.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-498" title="diy cushion" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/diy-cushion.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1189" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>Then I did a couple of calculations and measurements to work out how many lines to do and words/letters per line. I used tape to make a straight line each time I did a row so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get all wonky. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth using a pencil with the stencil before the pen to make sure the words all fit in, remember the pen is permanent! Then it&amp;rsquo;s just simply using the fabric marker to stencil in the letters and fill them in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2690.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-500" title="IMGP2690" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2690.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="405" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s done :) It did take me quite a while to do but that&amp;rsquo;s because I do usually take a while over things like this, but I enjoy doing it! Really pleased with how it came out - these cushions would make great gifts too!&lt;/p>

My friend Emma lent me her &lt;a href="http://www.modelsownit.com/nails/nail-art-pens.html" target="_blank">Models Own Nail Art Pen&lt;/a> in Black so I could have a play with it. I've never tried any of these pen style things before, so this is my first attempt :p So that's my reasoning as to why my lines are so wobbly! I found it had to be squeezed quite hard to get the varnish out, but I enjoyed using it and would love to try out different things with them.
&lt;p>For my nails I used Nails Inc&amp;rsquo;s Palace Gardens Terrace which is a lovely chocolatey brown, and then used the pen on top of it first doing 2 or 3 stripes then a chevron pattern on top. I think they&amp;rsquo;d look great in Autumn, they aren&amp;rsquo;t very summery like the weather we&amp;rsquo;ve been having recently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2650.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-476 aligncenter" title="chevron-nails" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2650-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
Ooh and look - my new ring :) This was one of the free things I got off eBay when they were giving away &lt;a title="Free £5 To Spend on eBay" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/free-5-to-spend-on-ebay/" target="_blank">free fivers&lt;/a>, it was only £1 inc p&amp;amp;p from Hong Kong. I think it's so cute!
&lt;p>Have you ever tried nail art pens? Any tips?&lt;/p>

I was looking forward to seeing how it compared to the chinese food we have here, and a Friday night eating chinese food sounded perfect! Here&amp;rsquo;s what we had:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kung Pao Chicken&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chinese Pork Ribs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chinese Chicken Curry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And a 'McFlurry' for desert made by Claire ;)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
It was all really good! Will's speciality was the ribs, and they were amazing, the sauce was lovely to dip stuff in after we all devoured the ribs. Was all a lot better than any chinese takeaway I've had in Britain! I took some pics of the food before tucking in, they're not very good quality unfortunately and it's hard to make food like this look good in pics, but believe me it was all so good.

Hope you&amp;rsquo;ve all had a lovely day :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed spending time doing no uni work at all :). Last week I had a test and 2 projects due in so I was working all day and night for all of that, so I decided this weekend would be a chilled out one! Friday night involved watching 3 hours of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108941/" target="_blank">The Stand&lt;/a>, Saturday was a crafty day and today was a beautiful sunny day so I went to town with my boyfriend for a wander and used my birthday vouchers to get a few goodies!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scrapbooking&lt;/strong>. On Saturday I continued on my scrapbook which is starting to get a lot bigger. I&amp;rsquo;m scrapping my trip to the US that me and my boyfriend took last summer, gives me holiday blues so much. I will blog about my scrapbook more when it&amp;rsquo;s finished. It&amp;rsquo;s my first attempt at making a scrapbook so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to some people&amp;rsquo;s, but I love this way of keeping my memories!  I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get the pages together first and then do the journaling after, so some pages are quite plain at the mo. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peak!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-400 aligncenter" title="Scrapbook Grand Canyon" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">2. &lt;strong>Shopping&lt;/strong>. Today I used up most of my birthday vouchers and had a walk around Edinburgh in the sunshine. I managed to pick up the following, and I'm so excited by it all!&lt;/p>
[gallery link="file" order="DESC" orderby="post_date" exclude="400, 399"]
&lt;p>Look how cute those &lt;a href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/pens-+amp-pencils/panda-highlighters-pack-of-5/invt/00485861/">panda highlighters&lt;/a> are?! I love Paperchase stationery, just wish it was a bit better for the budget. I got that 17 &lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/en/17-Fast-Finish-Nail-Polish_927316/" target="_blank">nail polish&lt;/a> from Boots in &amp;lsquo;Pink Lemonade&amp;rsquo;, will try it out tonight - looks lovely and fresh like summer! Went to The Works too and picked up a canvas for £2.99 - bargain!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then popped into Waterstones to use my book vouchers. I had looked online for some ideas before I went as I know I&amp;rsquo;d be in there for ages trying to decide between them all! Firstly I bought &lt;a href="http://www.sjwatson-books.com/beforeigotosleep/about/" target="_blank">Before I Go to Sleep&lt;/a> by S. J. Watson - &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Memories define us. So what if you lost yours every time you went to sleep?&lt;/em> An original, haunting, and deeply chilling debut.&amp;rdquo; I enjoy reading books like this and this one sounds particularly interesting, the boyfriend fancies having a read of this after me too. Then I bought &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You&lt;/a> by Jojo Moyes - a girly book, don&amp;rsquo;t think the boyfriend will read this one :p. I wanted to also buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pink-Hotel-Anna-Stothard/dp/1846881315" target="_blank">The Pink Hotel&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Into-Darkest-Corner-Elizabeth-Haynes/dp/0956251579/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1332094500&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Into the Darkest Corner&lt;/a>, but they&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been up to this weekend? Enjoying the sun where you are?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I managed to get the Signature box, and my boyfriend got the Egglets basket, mmmm. Need to pick those up asap!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, whilst I&amp;rsquo;m here, there have been a few codes going around for free cinema tickets to see Headhunters, The Cabin in the Woods and The Hunger Games, but have all run out really quickly. It seems they are released 5 mins before I leave my flat for uni the past couple of days, gutted! But that usually means more will be being released soon so I will keep you updated if I manage to find some.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I did end up making cheescakes using the new Philadelphia with Cadbury, and they are so yum!!  They are so quick and easy to make, and the philadelphia alone is really nice which I found surprising as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what it would be like. You could just spread it on a digestive and you&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much got a tasty cheesecake already. But I decided to go ahead and make the cheesecakes featured on the Philadelphia website &lt;a href="http://www.philadelphia.co.uk/philadelphia3/page?locale=uken1&amp;amp;PagecRef=609&amp;amp;rid=40107&amp;amp;fb_source=message" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;span style="text-align: center;">160 g Philadelphia with Cadbury&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">180 g double cream&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">20 g icing sugar&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
Firstly to make the base just bash up the biscuits in to crumbs and mix with the melted butter. Place the mix in to 5 ring moulds (6-7cm) or ramekins or maybe just make one big cheesecake, and place in the fridge. Then in a bowl whisk together the Philadelphia with Cadbury (the tub is 160g so use it all), double cream and icing sugar. Once it's all mixed together and looking good (have a taste ;)), place it on to the cheesecake bases and spread it all over the top, then return them to the fridge for a couple of hours to set. You could add whatever you'd like to the philly mixture, like fudge pieces or chocolate chips, to make it even better!
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2565.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-387 aligncenter" title="IMGP2565" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2565-300x218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
They make just the right sized cheesecakes, perfect. The Philadelphia is currently on offer at Asda for £1 for a 160g tub. Let me know if you make any, or have tried the Cadbury Philadelphia!

&lt;p>[gallery link=&amp;ldquo;file&amp;rdquo; columns=&amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Top: 1 / 2 Bottom: 3 / 4&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;/p>
1.  &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389137/" target="_blank">We Bought a Zoo&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong> I went to see this film this morning thanks to RBS, and I really enjoyed watching it. It was a sad film, as like a lot of family movies, the Mum has died and so it's up to the Dad to look after the kids alone. The daughter Rosie is so cute, and I think Matt Damon makes a great Dad in it. They basically buy a zoo, which I totally would love to do now, and well I'll leave it up to &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389137/" target="_blank">IMDb&lt;/a> to summarise. It's based on a true story too, and think it's great that the real life family still have the zoo.
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1232829/" target="_blank">21 Jump Street&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. I saw this on Tuesday, and as I expected, it was a great comedy that I&amp;rsquo;d recommend. Jonah Hill is so funny in it! It&amp;rsquo;s based on the TV show from the 80s which starred Johnny Depp, although this is comedy unlike the original. Basically 2 guys that went to school together join the police force and end up working undercover in a high school trying to tackle a drugs case. Watch the trailer and go see it!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Funny Peculiar&lt;/strong>. Me and my boyfriend went to see this in the Festival Theatre last week. We weren&amp;rsquo;t really expecting much as we didn&amp;rsquo;t really know anything about it. We were sat 5 rows from the front, so we were surprised with how good seats we were given for free! It was such a random but funny play, and was weird to see people from TV on stage (incl. Coronation Street&amp;rsquo;s Janice Battersby, Suzanne Shaw, etc). As we walked in there was a sign saying &amp;lsquo;This play contains full nudity,&amp;rsquo; and we weren&amp;rsquo;t expecting that! We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have seen it if the tickets weren&amp;rsquo;t free, as it&amp;rsquo;s not something I would normally do because tickets are so expensive usually for theatre, so glad we got to though!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Baking&lt;/strong>. I baked chocolate cupcakes with chocolate buttercream last weekend and they were yummy! I followed &lt;a href="http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/499762/libbie-s-chocolate-cupcakes" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> recipe for the cupcakes, and it was alot easier than the last ones I made. Hardly any butter in comparison, so a lot less work for my arms trying to mix it all together, and a lot less calories! I used my new Tala measuring cup which I was delighted to be given from George East Housewares last week. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to use, especially when using American recipes which I do a lot of the time, and looks lovely!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve bought some &lt;a href="http://www.philadelphia.co.uk/philadelphia3/page?siteid=philadelphia3-prd&amp;amp;locale=uken1&amp;amp;PagecRef=842&amp;amp;cid=1337&amp;amp;pid=2188" target="_blank">Cadbury Philadelphia&lt;/a> today that I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of making a cheesecake with it tomorrow. Will let you know how that goes, I love Cadbury!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone tried it yet? Or is chocolate cheese a no-go?&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;a href="http://uk.megabus.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Megabus&lt;/a> many times travelling from Edinburgh back to Cardiff, with a change at London, it&amp;rsquo;s almost a 16hour journey including the changeover. 16hours feels like so long, and it really is being cramped on a bus, but when it only costs us a couple of quid it&amp;rsquo;s the only way we can afford to get back. Flights can be £80 return and that&amp;rsquo;s without baggage, and there&amp;rsquo;s no point even looking at trains! Yes we&amp;rsquo;ve had hellish journeys, like when we had to change buses 3 times because they kept breaking down. Then we were placed on a city bus driving on the motorway at literally 5mph till the driver refused to continue, and this being an overnight bus just added to the experience. But, I still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;d never use Megabus again, we got our money back and have used them since with no problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, today I found out that they are  bringing in services from the UK to Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Boulogne - from just &lt;strong>£1&lt;/strong>! Details from the &lt;a href="http://uk.megabus.com/megabuscom.aspx" target="_blank">website&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>From Monday 16 April 2012, megabus.com will begin to operate services from the UK to Boulogne, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam with two services per day in each direction.
In addition, there will be two further journeys per day in each direction linking Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.
&lt;p>Through bookings to all 4 new destinations will be available from many points across the UK with a change of vehicle at London Victoria Coach Station. Passengers will require to check in and provide passport information prior to boarding the coach at Victoria Coach Station before departure for the ferry crossing to the continent via either Dover or Ramsgate to either Calais or Boulogne. Regardless of the port of arrival in France, all services will call at Boulogne to pick up and set down.&lt;/blockquote>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">It's an 8 hour journey from London to Amsterdam, which I don't think is too bad as you'd get to stretch your legs on the ferry. Just wish we lived near London!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">What do you think of Megabus? Do you think this is a good deal?&lt;/p>

I decided to follow a recipe from the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943" target="_blank">Baking Made Easy&lt;/a> by Lorraine Pascale. I thought the recipe was good, but only if you are making very large cupcakes or more than than 12! Even though the recipe states that it makes 12, the cases were overfilled and there was so much buttercream!! Got enough for 12 more cakes leftover, and cut the peaks off the cakes which were eaten very quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2484.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-298 aligncenter" title="IMGP2484" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2484-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
I tried out my &lt;a title="New Icing Bag Set" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/tala-icing-bag-set/">Tala icing bag&lt;/a> too, and it was really good! The buttercream was sooo stiff though, I'll try a different recipe next time, so the icing didn't come out so good because of this as my hand was hurting :/ But they tasted good and that's the main thing! I used coloured shimmer sugar in pink and blue to match the cases and make them look pretty.
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2512.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-299 aligncenter" title="IMGP2512" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2512-300x263.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="263" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
I wonder how long they'll last...! Any recommendations of good recipes for buttercream?

We both enjoyed it, and this was probably mostly because of the cast! It&amp;rsquo;s not a movie that takes itself serious and I found it funny (especially the character Trish) and quite a few people in the cinema were laughing really loud that it felt like we were in the States! If you want to see a screening of this, try my post &lt;a title="Free Cinema – This Means War (Multiple Dates)" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/free-cinema-this-means-war-multiple-dates/">here&lt;/a> for free tickets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tonight my friend came over for a movie night with lots of chocolate! We watched &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1204342/" target="_blank">The Muppets&lt;/a> first and enjoyed it especially the songs, you&amp;rsquo;ve gotta love Jason Segel he just makes you smile! Was also looking forward to seeing Neil Patrick Harris in it, but he just appeared for a few seconds (I&amp;rsquo;m a HIMYM fan btw if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell). Then we watched &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596365/" target="_blank">The Woman in Black&lt;/a> and we wished we&amp;rsquo;d watched this before The Muppets! I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it would be that scary because it&amp;rsquo;s only a 12A, but there were a few jumpy moments and I may have screamed twice. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it but maybe not if, like me, you were going to be alone shortly after the movie ends. I have turned on every light in my flat so I won&amp;rsquo;t get creeped out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What movies have you seen recently? I&amp;rsquo;d recommend all of the above :)&lt;/p>

This afternoon the postie came and delivered my new Tala icing bag set, and I love the look of it. The tin is really cute and handy to keep all the bits together. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose any like I did with my old set and there&amp;rsquo;s also enough room (if you take out the packaging) to store more bits and pieces. It looks really good quality, just excited to try it out now. So plans for this weekend shall include baking cupcakes, my boyfriend will be happy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2438.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-243 aligncenter" title="IMGP2438" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2438-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
I bought it from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002U5C4ZC/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=103612307&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=B000EUKOMA&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=17E9952TCET6ZSFR68AP" target="_blank">Amazon&lt;/a> and cost me £9.98, which is quite expensive but for the quality and look (and birthday cash) I think it's worth it.

Today is pancake day, so of course I had to make pancakes for breakfast :) Over the weekend I made the Martha Stewart pancakes which I wrote about &lt;a title="Valentine’s Baking and Craft Ideas" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/valentines-baking-and-craft-ideas/">here&lt;/a> and they were more American style and were &lt;em>really&lt;/em> good! I usually make the thin type and generally follow &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/basicpancakeswithsuga_66226">this&lt;/a> recipe, although I only use 1 egg, and I made these today as I think they're quicker to make than American style. Sadly we've run out of nutella but I still had a couple of strawberries with sugar. Although the bag of sugar does seem to have a hole in the bottom as my kitchen floor was covered in it afterwards, oops :/
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-215 aligncenter" title="IMGP2432" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2432-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/p>
I've been spending a bit of my birthday money online and am currently waiting for my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tala-Icing-Bag-Nozzles-Booklet/dp/B002U5C4ZC/ref=sr_1_2?s=kitchen&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1329864909&amp;amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">Tala Icing Bag Set in Tin&lt;/a> so I can start baking cupcakes as I've lost part of my old icing bag set, and this one looks so cute in the tin! I'm also expecting my &lt;a href="http://www.echoparkpaper.com/collections/for-the-record/" target="_blank">Echo Park For the Record&lt;/a> Paper Collection Kit to come soon, so I can continue scrapbooking, love the alphas and elements in this set. So hopefully they'll be here tomorrow!
&lt;p>I also just found out that last Thursday was apparently something called &lt;a href="http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/90408,Poles-gorge-themselves-on-Fat-Thursday" target="_blank">Fat Thursday&lt;/a>, gutted I missed out on that one. It&amp;rsquo;s a Polish tradition, an alternative to pancake day, where they basically eat a lot of doughnuts - I&amp;rsquo;ve marked it on my calender for next year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone celebrate Fat Thursday here? Seems like a good thing to celebrate :p&lt;/p>

I had a great Valentine's day, breakfast in bed and after Uni I came home to a lovely bouquet of red roses. I gave my boyfriend these truffles, there were 22 of them but by the time I took these pics there were only 3 remaining! So I can assume that he enjoyed them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2378.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-186" title="IMGP2378" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2378-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">We went to see Titanic in 3D at the cinema, it was so good! The quality looks like a brand new film and the 3D was really good, not in your face and didn't make me feel ill like it sometimes does. I'd recommend going to see it when it comes out on April 6th, and don't forget the tissues! We had eaten dinner before going but didn't have time to have dessert so I quickly made some when we got in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">We had bought some strawberries and cream, and we've still got a supply of chocolate from Christmas that we don't really like eating as a bar so I use it for baking with. I decided to make a chocolate ganache which I had made before from the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jamies-30-Minute-Meals-Revolutionary-Approach/dp/0718154770" target="_blank">Jamie's 30-Minute Meals&lt;/a>. I just halved the ingredients and adapted it a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">[hr]&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;">Chocolate Ganache&lt;/h2>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2380.jpg">&lt;img class=" wp-image-187 alignnone" title="IMGP2380" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2380-300x283.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="283" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">It's so quick and simple to make. The ingredients I used were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>100g bar good quality chocolate (I used G&amp;amp;B's Maya Gold which is infused with orange and spices)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>150ml single cream&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A pinch of salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knob of butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Handful of strawberries for dipping&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
In Jamie's recipe he uses clementines in the ganache but using this chocolate it wasn't needed. I put all of the ingredients (minus the strawberries) into a heatproof bowl over boiling water to melt it all together.
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2395.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-188 aligncenter" title="IMGP2395" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2395-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">And it's done! Then just spoon it into whatever you have available and get dipping with whatever you fancy, so tasty!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2406.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-189 aligncenter" title="IMGP2406" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2406-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">So now I have 3 other bars remaining, any ideas on what I should do with them?!&lt;/p>

Which is why I have taken so long to write a post on here as I&amp;rsquo;ve been so busy, but now I have a bit of time I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a post about it. Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my boyfriend, family and friends for the lovely cards and gifts and for those that could make it out on the night!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a couple of weeks back my boyfriend asked me for some birthday ideas, and I found some jewellery that had been blogged about &lt;a href="http://sweetmondayblog.blogspot.com/">here&lt;/a> that I really wanted. Then when my birthday came and I opened my presents I was surprised to receive these two from him that I love :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly is a necklace from &lt;a href="http://www.wallpaperrose.bigcartel.com/">Wallpaper Rose&lt;/a> which is so cool as it  has a clock inside, and was prettily packaged with a bow. Wallpaper Rose is worth a look, I want more haha!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2333.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-139 aligncenter" title="IMGP2333" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2333-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2336.jpg">&lt;img class="wp-image-137" title="IMGP2336" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2336-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Secondly was this cute little friendship bracelet from &lt;a href="http://lilyloveslola.bigcartel.com/">Lily Loves Lola&lt;/a>. I'd recommend this shop, there are lots of different bracelets all at a good price of just £2.50 each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2339.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138" title="IMGP2339" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2339-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">[hr]&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">The Saturday wasn't just my birthday, it was also 2 of my friends birthdays too. So we all went out to Hive (classy.. :/) but it's so cheap there and we always have a good time! So of course I had to do my nails :) I decided to paint them with Avon mirror shine in bronze, which I've owned for years but hardly worn, and Barry M black crackle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2351.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-140" title="IMGP2351" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2351-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2353.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-141" title="IMGP2353" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2353-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I like the way they turned out and matched my dress. My dress was from &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4212208&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId&amp;amp;searchTerm=SEQUIN|&amp;amp;pageSize=20&amp;amp;fb_source=message#13276692761531&amp;amp;country:undefined^language:undefined^currencySymbol:undefined^preferredUrl:undefined^siteLabel:undefined^langId:undefined^storeId:undefined^salesCatalogId:undefined^viewed:undefined^explicit:undefined" target="_blank">Topshop&lt;/a> and was only £15 in the sale, and although the sequins rubbed my arm a bit, I really liked it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/Dress.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-143" title="Dress" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/Dress-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">So that's my birthday done for a year and next up is Valentine's day, time is flying by! We managed to grab some Titanic 3D tickets for tomorrow and I am so glad I kept checking for them, be persistent and hope for cancellations if you want to see it. Hope you all have a lovely day filled with love and chocolate :)&lt;/p>

Also, I have just requested a free sample of Loreal Hair Expertise shampoo &amp;amp; conditioner! I say samples but they are full sized bottles - 250ml. Here's the link where they are giving them away: &lt;a href="http://apps.facebook.com/hairexpertise/" target="_blank">Loreal Hair Expertise&lt;/a>. The first 4300 entrants will receive it, so don't hesitate!

Well&amp;hellip; I thought it was going to be an alright movie, more my boyfriends type of film, and came away thinking it was just OK. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exactly recommend it but it&amp;rsquo;s the type of film that I might put on if it was on TV. It was just a bit cheesy and unrealistic in parts. Just not my cup of tea!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again Virgin provided us with popcorn, woo! But this time it was in Odeon and their popcorn isn&amp;rsquo;t so nice compared to Cineworld - but I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna complain about free stuff, we still ate it!! We even had our photo taken on the way in :/ We were told it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going on the website it&amp;rsquo;s just to show that they are doing their jobs, phew&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief bit from IMDb about the storyline of the movie:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>"Soon after her divorce, a fiction writer returns to her home in small-town Minnesota, looking to rekindle a romance with her ex-boyfriend, who is now happily married and has a newborn daughter."&lt;/blockquote>
I thought it was really good, there's funny bits but it is quite a depressing movie, don't expect a happy ending type! The acting was really good, particularly Charlize Theron (who was actually nominated for a Golden Globe for this film) and Patton Oswalt.
&lt;p>It was pretty busy, but still quite a few spaces left, it&amp;rsquo;s a shame that people miss out when people get the tickets but don&amp;rsquo;t turn up! Looking forward to seeing Man On a Ledge tomorrow thanks to Virgin Media (hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll get free popcorn as they usually supply us with some!)&lt;/p>

CINEMA</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/free-cinema/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2012 22:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/free-cinema/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are many companies that offer free cinema tickets to the public, with most of the viewings before the film is released. The reason they do this is simply for publicity, as they hope that you will enjoy the film and spread the word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I previously had a Cineworld Unlimited card and used to use it whenever I had the chance (I have made a poster out of all my old cinema tickets which I shall have to post on here sometime ;)). When I started university my budget shrunk and unfortunately I had to give it up. My boyfriend buys me Empire magazine subscription each year for my birthday, and I really enjoy reading it but it&amp;rsquo;s a shame that I have to wait so long to see all the films. But, last year I was looking online for cheap/free things to do and stumbled upon these free cinema tickets! All that you have to do is enter a code on a website, select the cinema and the number of tickets and you are given a ticket to print and take along with you. So simple!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first film I saw was Drive (great movie) which we went to see at &lt;a title="Cameo Picturehouse" href="http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema/Cameo_Picturehouse/" target="_blank">Cameo Picturehouse&lt;/a>. This was the first time we had been there and we loved it! It&amp;rsquo;s all old school with really comfy chairs, not like the plasticky ones at multiplex cinemas - highly recommend it. Since then we have seen all sorts of movies at different cinemas across Edinburgh almost every week. We are even greeted with a bag of popcorn and other goodies occasionally!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I woke up late even though I had a relatively early night (it is Sunday though after all), and one of the first things I do is get on the laptop and check for free cinema tickets. Sadly, I was too late - all tickets were gone for Titanic 3D and The Muppets. See these deals go quick and if you want the tickets you have to grab them whilst you can. There may still be cancellations and more released so not all hope is lost! Tomorrow we have tickets for Young Adult, and on Tuesday we are seeing Man On a Ledge - can&amp;rsquo;t wait! It&amp;rsquo;s even better that my flat is behind Cineworld and so only takes 5mins to walk there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, if you love going to see the latest movies then you may as well save yourselves some money. I will post here any deals that I come across as soon as I find them and then hopefully you can get them too, just be quick!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some of the websites I use to find them, I am so thankful for those that share ticket codes on forums:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start by introducing myself. I&amp;rsquo;m a 21-year-old living in Edinburgh with my incredible boyfriend of 6 years. I study Maths (3rd year), enjoy making things and love anything that&amp;rsquo;s free. I hate being cold, which is made worse as my flat has no heating. But anyway,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started thinking of creating this  blog when I came home  from a night of free food and wine at the Italian restaurant Zizzi. I told my friends about the event but it was too late for them to get tickets, and they said that I always manage to find these free things to do so often but they don&amp;rsquo;t have time to look around for them. So now they can just look here instead of traipsing around the web. I may spend too much time refreshing pages and searching, but it&amp;rsquo;s all worth it when I can go to the cinema almost every week and not pay a thing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also love creating things, from fresh cupcakes to cute scrapbooks, and want to share the things I enjoy making. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll inspire more people to make things, and save a bit of cash too!&lt;/p>

Thought the traffic would be bad (carmageddon) but it was surprisingly quiet the whole way. We stopped off for a McDonalds breakfast which was yummy and included pancakes with maple syrup. We were due to drop off the car to Alamo at 10am, but before that we had to get rid of all our camping gear as we couldn&amp;rsquo;t fit any of it to bring back with us. This was a lot harder than we thought, as we drove around searching for a bin (we tried to find a charity shop but had no luck). We noticed a truck pulling off the road and pulled up next to a dumpster, so we drove around a bit until he was gone and did the same. Was quite funny how we were trying to do it secretly as we weren&amp;rsquo;t sure whether it was legal or not. We continued to Alamo where we quickly and easily dropped the car off with no hassle.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
Was sad to say goodbye, and realised as we'd left on the shuttle bus that we'd left our large iced tea on the back of the trunk (see pic).
&lt;p>Arrived at LAX and headed to the Delta terminal, quick easy check in and straight through security (through the body scanner machines). It is currently being re-done so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a very nice place to wait as there wasn&amp;rsquo;t really anything there. We found an escalator that went down to these tunnels that link the terminals. A nice Southern woman pulled up on a buggy and asked us if we wanted a lift, which we said yes to as we had no idea where we were going. She zoomed along and we were in a much nicer terminal. We went to a few shops and had some food here before heading back and finding some seats to have a read. After a while I decided to look at the time and noticed it was only 20 mins to departure! So we quickly went to the gate and they were shouting &amp;rsquo;last call&amp;rsquo; and so we managed to make it - the last people on the plane oops.. The journey was fine to Detroit and before we knew it we were there. Got a bit lost as we weren&amp;rsquo;t sure whether to pick up our bags (apparently not), and looked around the shops although most were closed. We sat right by the departure gate this time as we didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna miss it. At about 30mins to departure people started to queue so we got up and then noticed on the screen it said Detroit - London Heathrow cancelled, and heard lots of people complaining.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width: auto;">

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
After about 10mins they announced it on the speakers that it was cancelled due to maintenance and they'd give us vouchers for food and a hotel, but there wasn't any space on the direct flight to Heathrow tomorrow. So we waited for ages to get to the front, and we were told we'd be put on flights tomorrow late afternoon to Chicago, then on to Heathrow arriving early morning on Monday. We also had to go back and get a refund on our duty free stuff.
&lt;p>The queue for the hotel shuttles were huuge. Chatted to a guy who had managed to get a direct flight tomorrow somehow who was staying at a different hotel. We were put in to the Metropolitan Hotel which was nice on the outside, but outdated once you get past the lobby. We were really hungry as we hadn&amp;rsquo;t eaten since breakfast and it was around 11.30pm. We asked the guy at the desk how we could use our vouchers and luckily there was a takeaway nearby that accepted them. Tried to call up but was engaged, so had to go online and order it there. Didn&amp;rsquo;t really know how to let them know we were using vouchers so wrote it anywhere we could, mistakenly put it in the part where you ask for special requests on your pizza&amp;hellip; It arrived at 1am and paid with our $12 voucher and pennies for the tax. We then headed to bed, and was woken up at around 2.30am telling us our pizza had arrived even though we ate it an hour earlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the morning we got the shuttle to the airport, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t use the check-in kiosks so had to join the big queue of everyone who was in the same situation as us. Spoke to someone who had been put on a flight to Atlanta and then to Heathrow, seems we were all going different ways. Finally got to the desk where we stood for half an hour as they hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually issued us tickets despite booking us on to the flights. The airport was nice, big and looked quite new. Got on this plane fine, although we didn&amp;rsquo;t have seats together. Unfortunately it was a really small plane and Jon so happened to be sitting by the biggest man imaginable. He was actually sat in Jon&amp;rsquo;s aisle seat with the armrest up, so Jon was stuck by the window with only half a seat&amp;hellip; not pleasant. Luckily the flight was only just over an hour long. We only had an hour to connect and the lady at the Delta desk in Detroit said that it&amp;rsquo;d be fine as the British Airways desks are in the same terminal and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to go through security again. Well it turned out that after asking a policeman it was in a different terminal and we&amp;rsquo;d have to redo security. We had to speed walk through and onto the train and check-in all over again. The woman at check-in let us and another family in the same situation go to the front as there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much time left. We managed to stop at duty free with just over 20mins till departure. This plane was a double decker -  the biggest one I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been on and had so much room. Watched some movies including No Strings Attached, and had chicken curry. It was an overnight flight but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep, and there was turbulence most of the way. Finally arrived in the UK at 7am where my Mum was waiting to pick us up and drive us back to Cardiff. Felt weird being back and driving on the other side of the road, and we could already feel the holiday blues kicking in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So our holiday is now over and is going to take some time to sink in, as we have seen and done so much over the past 3 weeks. Will post a stats/favourites page up soon. We had such an amazing time and would definitely recommend a road trip to anyone! :)&lt;/p>

It was only a 15min drive away, and by the time we were through parking ($15) and walking through City Walk it was a little after 9am, the time the park opens. We bought our tickets which were quite expensive at $75 each.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width: auto;">

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
It was really quiet as we got there so early, and after walking through the gates a lady approached us and asked us if we could do a survey for her. We said yes iffily and answered a couple of questions and were then given queue jump pass for the studio tour! Had read last night that the best way to do the park if you arrive early is the studio tour, then the lower lot and finally the upper lot. So we headed for the tour and used our queue jump so had no wait. We boarded the tram and sat on the left (the best side to sit).
&lt;p>Began the studio tour by driving around all the currently used sound stages, most of them closed up looked like they were in use. Saw a few bits and pieces and went in to the King Kong 3D experience, it was incredible, best 3D we&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. Didn&amp;rsquo;t realise until halfway through there were screens on both sides (King Kong was killing Dinosaurs oh yeah). Then we did the outdoor lots, the New York plot which looked great but didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go through it as they were preparing it for filming a new movie. Transformers 3 was just filmed there. After that drove past the famous cars from movies bit which was also really cool, every car would be followed by an ooh and aah. Saw the DeLorean from Back to the Future, jeeps from Jurassic Park and the good cars from fast and the furious.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width: auto;">

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
Next we went to the set from Jaws with a fully functioning mechanical shark (the one they actually used in the movies). Wisteria Lane followed that, where they were actually filming when we drove past, saw a "Silence on set" sign which was cool. War of the Worlds plane crash set was insane, which we went to next. Had a real Boeing 747 smashed up as part of the set, looked very realistic, apparently a Pilot who flew over the set called in an emergency saying that there had been a plane crash haha. There was so  much stuff it could easily be a blog post just on the studio tour, Jimmy Kimmel did the video guide ("Have a Tramtastic Day!").
&lt;p>We walked down to the lower lots, which were surprisingly empty and went straight for the Jurassic Park ride. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting much thought it was more of a child&amp;rsquo;s ride but the final drop was an 85ft vertical drop which scared the hell out of us and soaked us right through. Then we hopped over to The Mummy ride (feeling like we were kids again) put my bag into the fingerprint secured lockers (COOL). No queue at all, and surprised us again being so good. We went on it straight after with pretty much no queue the second time either. To be honest it was no where near as good the second time I think it is more of a shock factor ride.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the thrill of Jurassic Park and The Mummy rides we headed over to the Cinnabon stand to get some snacks (my Cinnamon swirl was 850calories and delicious). It was getting a lot busier by this time and the queue for the Studio Tour was 60mins!  Hit up the House of Horrors after Cinnabon, was the biggest queue yet of nearly 10mins and half worth the wait.&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/CvvYzz6SVq8cAy4eakYCgA?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MbTaOa9zTFk/TiGbDvKGDPI/AAAAAAAAAYk/d43ts82t_8M/s400/IMGP1978.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
Could have been scary but there are so many people walking around you are never alone long enough to get frightened. I did get jumped out on by this weird mummy thing which made me poop myself but other than that was a walk through a dark house.  On to the Terminator 2: 3D show&amp;hellip;.Wow, first sign it was old was when Sarah remembers watching the trailer for it on the Terminator 2 VHS. Then on to the show - pretty much a joke. Everything was ancient, apart from the guy onstage who was supposed to be Arnold Schwarzenegger who looked nothing like him. Aftwerwards we went to Shrek 4D, where we got lucky and managed to join the back of the queue just as everyone started moving and got into the next showing. Was much, much better than the Terminator 2: 3D nonsense. Really funny with the weird moving seats (SPOILER).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then the Special Effects Stage, got seats right at the front which was awesome, two classic American presenters bantering with each other. There was also Larry the hilarious stage hand which was apparently his &amp;ldquo;first day&amp;rdquo;. We were a bit nervous to be sat so close to the front when they started asking for volunteers but luckily there were lots of eager people in the audience, someone sat right behind us screamed for a chance and got chosen. They spoke about and demonstrated CGI, motion capture (was cool to see it being done), etc. Was a really good show, funny and informative. It was about 3.15 and we were aiming to leave at 4 so we had enough time to do one last thing  - The Simpsons Ride. The queue took 35mins but didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it as there were tv&amp;rsquo;s everywhere showing The Simpsons so could watch whilst we waited. We weren&amp;rsquo;t really sure what the ride was and found it weird when the queue split and people were going upstairs as we were going downstairs. We ended up in a tiny room of 6 before getting on the ride. Won&amp;rsquo;t spoil it for anyone but we both really enjoyed it and was nothing like anything we&amp;rsquo;ve seen/been on before!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the thrill of the park we headed to the shops for some last minute souvenir buying and a well needed rest. We went to Starbucks where we had the worst customer service&amp;hellip; Hardly any staff so a big queue, and the staff that were working weren&amp;rsquo;t really doing a lot and gave the wrong drink to one woman. Then we received the wrong drink too, and the woman was really rude about it, muttering to the other workers about it! Glad to get out of there and finish our coffees we headed back to the hostel. Didn&amp;rsquo;t stay long as it was around half 6 and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave packing too late. We found directions for the nearest Walmart - about 15mins away. When we arrived there it looked a bit scary, but found out it was right next to a police station. We bought lots of American snacks so we could bring some back with us, then went back to the hostel to find directions to In-n-out burger. We&amp;rsquo;d been looking forward to this for a while as we&amp;rsquo;d read such great reviews about it. And it definitely was the best fast food we&amp;rsquo;d had this holiday! There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much choice but didn&amp;rsquo;t need any more than it offered, was really fresh, great service, the fries were a bit weird compared to other places (they are cut in the store).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went back to the hostel for the last time&amp;hellip; packed everything up which took quite a while. Both feeling sad to leave we went to sleep at about 12.30. Getting up earlier than originally planned as we are slightly worried about carmageddon!&lt;/p>

We had a long day ahead of us darting around LA, so got ready quick and set off in the car. We headed straight for Hollywood that was only a few mins away, on the way we had a diversion, there were lots of police &amp;amp; fire trucks and they had closed a block off with flares lit on the floor. We were on Hollywood Blvd so looked for parking and went to Hollywood &amp;amp; Highland as the parking was only $2. We walked up to a higher level of the shopping centre for views of the Hollywood sign where we got a couple of pics before heading down to Starbucks for breakfast. We then carried our coffees on to the street where we walked up and back down looking at the stars on the floor.&lt;/p>

Got lots of photos of them including Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Michael Jackson. We continued past the Kodak Theatre (home of the Oscars) and up to Grauman's Chinese Theatre. I put my hands in Marilyn Monroe's imprints and Jon in Arnie's among others.
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sn9QZSTfkMtv_-AWooK43A?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-T1sDqwHANwE/TiDvdau5x3I/AAAAAAAAAWI/5xOJNjium7s/s400/IMGP1823.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
There was also a Star Wars one where r2d2's wheels were imprinted. We continued to look at the stars, Jon wanted to find Will Smith's but didn't manage to. We considered a Star Homes Tour, but our parking only lasted 2 hours before it would start to get really expensive, so went back to the car for a little drive around ourselves.
&lt;p>We headed for Sunset Boulevard, passing firstly by the Capitol Records building. On Sunset Blvd we drove by the Comedy Store, Johnny Depp&amp;rsquo;s The Viper Room (where River Phoenix died), and Rainbow Bar &amp;amp; Grill. We drove in to Beverly Hills where the average house price is over $2.2million! Drove around looking at all the huge houses (well gates that lead to houses..) until we spotted a tour bus which we then sneekily followed for a bit. We took photos of the ones they took photos of but have no idea whose homes they were. At least one of them we knew was Elvis Presley&amp;rsquo;s as there was a door on the gate with his name carved all over it. We came back out on to Sunset Blvd and turned off at Bel Air, but as soon as we turned we saw a huge gate to get in and Jon quickly made a u-turn, didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna get stuck with security. We then decided to stop at the $1.3billion Getty Center, mainly because $1.3bn is a lot but also it&amp;rsquo;s meant to have some pretty nice views up there. Admission was free but parking cost $15. We rode the tram up to the top and had a look around some galleries, saw Van Gogh&amp;rsquo;s Irises, and went up to a view point. It was quite a clear day and so could see across to downtown and out to the Pacific. We were looking for lunch here but didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything we fancied so just bought a drink. We had an iced coffee which was horrible, just coffee with ice in it that made us both feel ill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carried on down Sunset, stopping for gas, until we reached the coast. We drove to Santa Monica pier and parked at a lot that cost $8 for the day. The weather was lovely and sunny, so we set out to the beach and on to the pier.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0b1aXwWeJ8TkvJaMMfUOYQ?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EhvFLmOSUdo/TiDw5gPbRaI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/N1Gx8fKD4Gc/s400/IMGP1872.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
We bought some hotdogs and a cinnamon pretzel as we were so hungry by this point. We took some pics including one of a sign marking the end of route 66. Walked down to the beach where there were lots of people exercising on the outdoor equipment (rings, rope, etc). We followed the boardwalk to Venice Beach where the path started to fill with stalls, with lots of weird looking people about. There were hippies, people trying to sell their music, random acts (like a man standing on a ladder one legged holding 2 fake snakes shouting about corporate America) and people with big muscles. We then came to Muscle Beach which was a bit disappointing, all concrete and tired looking. The stuff at Santa Monica looked a lot better. Walked out on to the beach to have a sit down and watch the waves crash, was nice to have a rest. After about half an hour we went back to the car and there were quite a few cars in the lot waiting for spaces. A woman asked us if we were leaving so we said yes and offered them our ticket (as you pay for the space) for $5, which she seemed very pleased with so we only ended up paying $3 which was good.
&lt;p>Drove back towards the hostel, making a few stops along the way. Firstly we pulled off in to UCLA which was huge and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t really find our way around (we were looking for their gift shop), so we left after only a few mins. I looked on the map for a shopping centre and spotted the Beverly Centre so decided to head there. We looked around but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any good deals in any of the shops so went to the apple store so we could have a go googling other places to go. We found another one close by - Century City, so thought we&amp;rsquo;d stop there before it closed at 8pm. We left to go to the car park but must&amp;rsquo;ve taken the wrong escalators. We didn&amp;rsquo;t realise yet, so we paid for our ticket and attempted to find the car&amp;hellip; We couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it so were starting to panic as we knew we didn&amp;rsquo;t have long till our ticket would expire. We then realised we went down different escalators than the ones we came up, so had to find our way back through the mall and after around 10mins of rushing around we found it. We arrived at Century City but again there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any good sales so we just bought some socks as we had run out. It was just after 8 when we left, so we drove over to K-Mart which was a bit scary, and bought microwave pizzas and snacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We arrived back at the hostel and cooked our pizzas and drank beer whilst watching some movies and writing up the blog. Sad this&amp;rsquo;ll be our last proper sleep in the US, but excited about tomorrow as we are going to Universal Studios Hollywood!!&lt;/p>

Woke up at a reasonable 8am after another horrible nights sleep camping. (Can definitely conclude that after finishing all our camping, you either need to go for it 100% e.g. Buy an inflatable mattress and a camp stove, hammock etc or sleep in the car and spend nothing.) Walked down to the beach through an immaculately kept trail(NOT) and was pretty nice, really foggy though seems to take ages for the fog to clear especially the higher up you go.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pyXAvxE6BF1IqPTyBgWD6g?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6EUdOVOfRvM/Th8bsKA9Z3I/AAAAAAAAAVI/QBtxetRx9xc/s400/IMGP1779.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
We packed up the tent for the last time and headed off before 10. Drove for miles through thick fog. A lot of road works where there had been rock slides and it had taken the road with it, so sometimes had to wait up to 20minutes to get through the single lanes. Sarah and I were planning what to do in L.A whilst waiting though so it wasn't much of a problem.
&lt;p>Made a detour to drive through San Luis Obispo and stopped at the famous Madonna Inn.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7stvz8GOnQ2QjDwEgl1j-A?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Pms2cX5662s/Th8buzuyVFI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/-L0YJieXmpU/s400/IMGP1791.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
It has crazy décor with every room having a different theme, we just popped into the toilets as we had read that theses are something you should do if you are not staying at the hotel. Stopped off at McDonalds (again) for some snacks before hitting the road again. By the way, McDonalds really is that cheap, cheaper to buy food there than at a supermarket. $1 for a super large coke with 2 free refills against $1 for 900ml of powerade is no competition.
&lt;p>Carried on driving and stopped at Santa Barbara and Malibu(stacey). Got stuck in some bad traffic, just a taster of the carmageddon that will be coming on the day we leave. They are closing the 405 freeway which is the busiest road in L.A. The news has reported that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go out in your car as you will be jammed up for hours. Not looking forward to leaving even more so now that we are potentially going to be stuck in traffic trying to drop our car off and get to the airport.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Arrived at the orbit hostel after a few wrong turns and many turn arounds. Tried to check in and must have forgotten to read through the terms and conditions of this place as it was cash only and we only had a few bucks on us. Had to run across to a Bank of America that was down the street to withdraw some money. A second pin guess later and a dash down the street we had money and paid for our three nights. Not before the receptionist had to pop her head out of her office to say we had given her $20 to little&amp;hellip;whoops. Went up to the room to get showered ASAP as we were desperate to head out for some food and to have a proper look around L.A. No wifi signal in our room so once we were ready we popped to the communal area to use the wifi and do some checks before we headed out. Found Pink&amp;rsquo;s, a really famous hot dog stand just around the corner from us so  went and got in line.( It was huge, took around an hour to get served and eaten, but well worth the wait. I had a stretch chilli dog and Sarah had a cheese chilli dog. It was chilli as in mexican bean chilli not just hot sauce(never had anything like it on hot dogs before) and was awesome, super tasty would definitely go back again, reasonably priced too. The wall there was covered with famous peoples photos and signatures so must be popular with the celebrity locals.&lt;/p>

From Pink's we headed straight to the grove shopping center not far from the orbit hostel. After a lot of searching we found the parking and where the cinema was (we planned on seeing transformers 3). Movie was due to start at 9.15 and we arrived into the cinema at 9.20, decided to risk it and get tickets for the 9.15 showing. Also got a medium popcorn(salty eugh) and a drink, made it in time for just after the start of the movie so we were pleased with our efforts. Movie wasn't great would have preffered to have a fire alarm go off after the first hour so everyone could leave thinking it was great. The last hour and a half were balls. Highlights of the cinema experience were A. Funny Americans doing what Americans do best laughing clapping and cheering in the movie. B. just how grand the cinema actually was, no tacky building here no sir, only the best for L.A.
&lt;p>Zoomed to the hostel to find no parking so risked it in a dodgy spot outside ( It was fine in the end) and had a well deserved sleep&amp;hellip;in a bed! Amazing how much you miss a bed not being in one for a night. Anywho its late and need some sleep after an action packed day, will try and write a blog post on it tomorrow.&lt;/p>

We were all packed up and ready by 9.30. We decided last night that we&amp;rsquo;d drive via Silicon Valley, as Jon wanted to see the Google headquarters there.So we left San Francisco and found the drive through a lot easier to when we first arrived. There was still a lot of fog around so was wet and cold outside. We came off the interstate at Mountain View, and followed Google&amp;rsquo;s directions until we reached &amp;lsquo;Google&amp;rsquo; which was the name of the street. We were looking for a big sign to get a photo of so we were searching around the huge offices. Was cool as we passed loads of google bikes, including a weird one with about 6 seats facing inwards in a circle to pedal and one at the front to steer. We also passed one building where we could see staff playing ping pong. Then we spotted a big sign next to a building which we guessed were the Android offices as outside was full of android stuff. So we stopped here for photos, noticing the staff passing us were casually on there way to work at 10.30 on their bikes with macbooks in the front baskets.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/kULdQz9MjzZAuAbmPA-qWQ?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-FFE5wB4_Xr0/Th8a9ndC4QI/AAAAAAAAATQ/f9uCRCFMiKs/s400/IMGP1594.JPG" height="400" width="300" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
After managing to find our way out, we stopped for food and gas. We first went to Krispy Kreme for 4 doughnuts which we ate before starting to feel a bit sick of sweet stuff, so we went across the road to McDonalds to get a double cheeseburger meal.It's crazy how many mcdonalds they must have here, whenever we're hungry and pull off a road we always manage to come across a mcdonalds. Back on the road we headed for Santa Cruz. Once we arrived we looked for parking by the boardwalk/pier. We drove up to one spot but found out it was $12, so we carried on and pulled into the meter parking just next to the lot. It was 25c for 10mins, which was all the quarters we had on us.. and the change machine wasn't working. So we thought we'd just stay for 10mins, and rushed over through the rides to the beach where the sun was shining. It was pretty busy, if we had longer we would've had a go on the roller coaster. We didn't have the time on us so quickly got back to the car to see the meter had expired so had to leave.
&lt;p>Carried on the drive until we hit Monterey, where we pulled off and parked in a garage at Cannery Row. We had a walk around here, and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be cool to go to the aquarium, but as it was expensive and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time we decided not to. We walked to the beach and could see sealions laying on the rocks, yay we managed to see some after theuy weren&amp;rsquo;t in San Fran. We saw a Ghiradelli shop and thought we had to go in and have the world famous sundae there, so we did whilst sitting out the back by the beach - yummmy!We then went to the next town, Carmel, where Clint Eastwood was once mayor. Searched around for &amp;lsquo;The Hog&amp;rsquo;s Breath&amp;rsquo; but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it, so instead went to the beach where there were big waves, with warnings of how dangerous they&amp;rsquo;d be. We were then on the &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; park of the CA-1 (Cabrillo Hwy/PCH) so I decided to film this until it ran outta battery so around an hours worth which we&amp;rsquo;ll speed up once we&amp;rsquo;re back. The views along this road were amazing, the ocean was so blue. We stopped at lots of view points for photos.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/n6wB9Nm2BvlMdNacX1HXsg?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OSJjyYIaevg/Th8byL3wStI/AAAAAAAAAVc/hDfdGsEz4pM/s400/IMGP1638.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
We were stuck behind 2 slow cars which was frustrating as they were doing 20 below the speed limit and you can't overtake. They weren't pulling into the pull out stops either.. We pulled off at a state park (can't remember name) and had to pay $10 to get in. We were looking for the waterfall that goes straight in to the Pacific Ocean (the only one that does) and after looking in my book discovered we were at the wrong place so exited straight away. Luckily our pass got us into the place we were looking for - Julia Pfeiffer. We parked up here and walked out to McWay Falls and got some pics. Didn't stay long as we were both hungry and thirsty.
&lt;p>Continued on the beautiful road until we saw a shop at Lucia. Bought firewood ($9), a croissant, cookie and water. The campground we are straying in doesn&amp;rsquo;t have drinking water. It was an expensive shop as there weren&amp;rsquo;t really any along the road. Tried to pay with Jons card but it kept declining it, the lady said when that message comes up it&amp;rsquo;s usually becuase of fraud. So we were both quite worried but knew we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have internet till tomorrow so forgot about it and paid with cash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We arrived at Kirk Creek Campground at 6.30pm, where we set up our tent for the last time in record speed. Lit the fire straight after too. The campsite was awesome, with views over the pacific ocean.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MyCLQspLdS5M3WKvs7JTLQ?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oKjaKYnktIU/Th8bhdMldKI/AAAAAAAAAUo/GwGIrBcLSj4/s400/IMGP1679.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
There was a bunny living at our site which was cute. We ate food around the fire, and chilled out drinking beer. We lit Jons cigar (thanks Bec) using the fire as we forgot to smoke it in Las Vegas. We watched the sunset from our beach which was lovely. It was cold here so stayed close to the fire until around 10pm when we went to the toilets which were scary as had no lights in them, and headed to bed. The tent was on grass this time so hoped for a better sleep, although we put the tent unknowingly over a huge lump which wouldn't help. Tomorrow is our last big drive to Los Angeles, which we are both excited and sad about!

We were all ready by 9, and had made lots of plans to fit in everything we wanted to see/do. We left and discovered how cold it was! We decided to go to the car to get some trousers and hoodies as shorts were a definite no. The fog was around so the air was wet and windy, felt good to get into some warmer clothes. We left for Lombard Street&amp;rsquo;s crookedest part which was just around the corner, where we encountered our first steep hill and wow it was steep. We made it to the bottom of the crooked part to get some pics, there were quite a few tourists here all looking tired from the walk. We continued up Lombard St where we planned to get a bus. However we were chatting away and didn&amp;rsquo;t realise how far we&amp;rsquo;d actually walked, so decided to just walk to Golden Gate Bridge instead of catching the bus. This was a 3.9mile walk (didn&amp;rsquo;t realise it was this long) but the views of the bay were fab. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t many tourists about  it was mainly joggers and people doing various exercises along the boardwalk. We picked up a hot chocolate as we were freezing which definitely helped. We finally made it to Fort Point and there were amazing views here, shame about the fog though.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
We nearly got splashed a few times by the waves which were coming up over the road.  We went in to the gift shop and bought a large coffee to warm us up some more before heading up to the bridge.
&lt;p>We took lots of photos of the bridge, but decided not to cross as we were cold and had lots more to do. We did a camera swap with a family from Los Angeles, took me a while to work out how to use their phone for their pic but managed it in the end. From here we caught a muni bus that would take us to the Golden Gate Park. It cost $2 for a transfer which means you can use any buses for 90mins (although ours lasted longer) which is a pretty good deal. The bus got quite crowded with lots of students from UCSF which is right near the park. Luckily we got off at the right stop and could see signs for the Japanese Tea Gardens which is where we were headed. The park was quite quiet as the weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good and it was still quite early, around 11.30. It&amp;rsquo;s huge though and we walked a lot here, our feet began to ache.. We got to the Japanese gardens but it cost $7 each so decided we&amp;rsquo;d rather the money to spend on food! We could see in though and it did look beautiful, maybe some other time.. We walked to the De Young Museum which currently had Picasso&amp;rsquo;s art inside, but was shut on a Monday so couldn&amp;rsquo;t get in. So we went to the Carousel which was built in 1912, and had a hotdog while watching it go round.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After refuelling on hotdog, we went out of the park to find a bus to Union Sq. We easily found the 21 trolley stop but just missed one so continued on until one came. The 21 stops at Alamo Sq too so we jumped off there to take some pics of the painted ladies, which looked really pretty.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
Caught the next bus which dropped us off at the Powell St cable car turnaround. Jon instantly recognized this area, so led us in to a mall where we stopped in A&amp;amp;F and Hollister, but as this was a central area the sales were only 30% off so didn't get anything. We walked around Union Sq. before noticing that it was nearly half 2 and our tickets ran out at 3. So it kinda went crazy as we rushed to Chinatown to have a little look and bought a souvenir before attempting to find a bus to Fisherman's Wharf. We arrived at the stop around 10 to, so we waited until 5 past but no bus... We had no more cash on us so couldn't catch the next bus if it ever arrived, so instead we decided to walk it.
&lt;p>We walked through Chinatown and up the hills past Coit Tower all the way to Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf, our feet were so tired. Headed straight for Boudin Bakery where we both had the &amp;lsquo;Best of Boudin&amp;rsquo; half sandwhich and soup in sourdough roll. I had grilled cheese and clam chowder, Jon had grilled cheese and chilli. We finally got to rest our feet although the floor was full of birds eating crumbs.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
The food was delicious and there was so much of it as always. After the well deserved rest we headed for one last stop before returning to the hotel for a rest. We went to Ghirardelli Sq. which was originally a chocolate factory now done up full of restaurants and shops. We of course headed straight for the Ghirardelli chocolate shop where we received a free sample which was delicious!
&lt;p>Our feet were now crying out for a lie down, so we walked back to the hotel. On the way Jon twisted his ankle pretty bad down a hill, which meant having to pretty much hop the rest of the way. Got back to the hotel and had a nap for an hour or so. Luckily Jon&amp;rsquo;s ankle was feeling a bit better after a rest as we had planned on eating out at Cafe Zoetrope. So at around 8ish we left, missed the turn but managed to find our way anyway as had kinda learnt the major roads now. Arrived at Francis Ford Coppola&amp;rsquo;s cafe, which was really nice but we felt a bit under-dressed. Was cool that it had a few of his awards on the wall and pictures from his movies. I had the Malfatti and Jon had the Tony Special Pizza, both were yummy! We walked the 15mins back to the hotel, but got to a big junction and walked back and forth 3 times crossing the same homeless guy until we conceded that we were lost. So we put some money in his pot and asked for directions to Mason St. Bless him, he was so nice and gave us the right directions so managed to get back fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just gone 10pm now, feeling really tired. We worked out we&amp;rsquo;ve walked around 12.5miles today up and down the hills.. so we shall sleep well. Tomorrow we are hitting the road again down the pacific coast to Big Sur, will be staying at a lovely campground on the coast so may not be able to post till the 13th when we&amp;rsquo;ll be in our final destination (aww) Los Angeles!&lt;/p>

We slept in till 8 (usually up at 6 on a campground) and packed everything up and got ready to leave. We were ready by 9 so headed over to Curry village and bought a Yosemite bear bottle opener souvenir and some milk duds, &lt;span>&lt;span>mmm&lt;/span>&lt;/span> tasty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hit the road at 9.30&lt;span>&lt;span>ish&lt;/span>&lt;/span> with a long day of driving ahead of us. We were both keeping our eyes peeled for bears but saw none. Boohoo. Did see a forest fire though as we were leaving the national park, was fully under control though and there were just tonnes of firefighters sat around not doing a lot. Was really cool to actually see one up close and personal, couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any good snaps, were moving quite quick and was quite smoky.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
On the way to the interstate the fuel light popped up and informed us we had 50miles till empty, we were still pretty much in the middle of nowhere (think it was a national forest) and hadn't gone past any gas stations since leaving the NP. Drove past 2 which we pulled in at and upon closer inspection found that they were closed down and looked pretty run down. Luckily found one though not too far after so was quite a relief. $3.89 a gallon which was our most expensive yet, but rather that than get stuck on the side of the road in front of a bunch of crazy guys on Harley Davidson's.
&lt;p>After we had been driving on the interstate for a while I started to get desperate for a wee, the road surface suddenly decided it was time to get super bumpy and was full of BIG potholes. This did not help my situation and so we took the first exit we could find ( miles away) but luckily America is full of &lt;span>&lt;span>McDonalds&lt;/span>&lt;/span> so we found one and stopped and got a burger and a drink and I had a well deserved wee. &lt;span>&lt;span>Aaaaahhhhhh&lt;/span>&lt;/span>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hit the worst traffic of our journey so far on the way to San Fran, the queues for the exits to Sacramento were huge and was crawling until we past the exit. Also was bad traffic at the tolls to go on the bay bridge. We paid the $5 toll, mostly in quarters as we had a pot full of them in the car &lt;span>&lt;span>hehe&lt;/span>&lt;/span>. On the bridge we managed to get our first glance of San Fran and it looked awesome, could see Alcatraz and the golden gate bridge. As we actually got into the city I got very stressed out with the driving, ran a red light by accident and then blocked a lane trying to turn left at a green light, got honked at and had to jump another red light &lt;span>&lt;span>yeehar&lt;/span>&lt;/span>.  We eventually made it to the hotel after a fair bit of stressing at around 3pm. Hotel looked gorgeous from the outside, classic &lt;span>&lt;span>san&lt;/span>&lt;/span> &lt;span>&lt;span>fran&lt;/span>&lt;/span> building. Checked in and brought all our bags up to the room, feels like home already and couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the tent we &lt;del>slept &lt;/del> tried to sleep in last night. We then paid $20 for 24hours of parking and drove round the block to park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a much needed shower and &amp;ldquo;freshen up&amp;rdquo; we headed down to fisherman&amp;rsquo;s wharf to check it out and have a wander around. Really busy, headed straight for the Boudin bakery to have a look and &lt;span>disappointed&lt;/span> to see no breakfast pizza on the menu! Still have soup in a roll though. Walked along to pier 39 to go look at the sea-lions, well some empty wooden floats that they usually sit on. Apparently they like it hot and go down south for their mating season, boohoo. Got some hot doughnuts and the smallest bottle of coke for the thirstiest people imaginable. $3 for 215ml.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Went ahead to board our boat to &amp;ldquo;The Rock&amp;rdquo;, was getting rather nippy now especially as we are used to the weather being above 100 most of the day, it was about 65 which is 50 less than the max we have experienced. After a thorough chilling and some great views we arrived on Alcatraz and followed the cool guide for a little while until we picked up our audio tours.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
We followed the audio tour and it was fascinating, really enjoyed it and would definitely say its a must do. After we finished the tour we dropped the equipment back off and headed to the gift shop to pick up a few things. Whilst we were there we saw a tour about the escape from &lt;span>&lt;span>Alcatraz in 1962 that&lt;/span>&lt;/span> was about to start so we managed to catch it just in time. It was great, me and Sarah were desperate to watch the movie starring &lt;span>&lt;span>Clint&lt;/span>&lt;/span> &lt;span>&lt;span>Eastwood&lt;/span>&lt;/span> "Escape from &lt;span>&lt;span>Alcatraz&lt;/span>&lt;/span>" based on the true story the guide was telling. Me and Sarah think that they did escape as they are still on America's most wanted list, and the FBI have been searching for 20 years and have found nothing major. On the boat back to San Francisco we got to see the sunset over the Rock

There was a crazy french kid taking a million photos and practically &lt;span>&lt;span>whooping&lt;/span>&lt;/span> to himself &lt;span>&lt;span>every time&lt;/span>&lt;/span> he got a good one. FRENCH PEOPLE ARE WEIRD. Either that or he had ADHD...oops.
&lt;p>Walked back to the hotel and stopped off at &lt;span>&lt;span>Safeway&lt;/span>&lt;/span> to grab some tea, weird black dude in the shop not buying anything just trying to chat up any single lady he could. Also the checkout lady (maybe a lady, could have been a guy) was really odd, super frantic at packing bags and sniffed the receipts before she gave them back&amp;hellip;We hurried home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Off to sleep now so we can get up super early and have a full day exploring the city and get some good pics of the golden gate bridge.&lt;/p>

After an OKish sleep (quite cool here) we were up, ready and into the car by 6.30. The roads were so quiet with only a few people about. We went straight for tunnel view but unfortunately as the sun was still quite low it was in the worst spot for photos so had to leave that for later. We carried on driving up to Glacier Point. Along the road 3 deer ran across the road in front of us, lots of chipmunks and a few californian ground squirrels - luckily we didn&amp;rsquo;t hit any. We arrived at Glacier Point (7214ft) and parked up before walking out to the viewpoint. We were the only ones there which was awesome, so could take lots of pics and have breakfast of trail mix whilst sitting on the rocks. We could see into the valley and all the famous points - Half dome, Yosemite falls, etc. Apparently this is a good place to spot bears but sadly we didn&amp;rsquo;t :(. After being harassed by chipmunks for our food we decided to drive to the trail head for sentinel dome, a moderate 2.2mile hike.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We parked up and headed out to the dome which would take us up to an elevation of 8100ft. It was a fantastic easy walk, with views all around. The view of Yosemite Falls in particular was amazing. At the top was also one of the worlds most famous dead trees - the Jeffrey Pine. After taking lots of photos we walked back to the car and drove off to Mariposa Grove. Here there are hundreds of giant Sequoias, where we went for a walk to the Grizzly Giant. The trees are HUGE, and the Grizzly Giant in particular is the 25th largest giant sequoia living today. It&amp;rsquo;s approx 209ft tall with a circumference of 96.5ft. It was hard to get pics of them as the photos just don&amp;rsquo;t show how big they really are.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
We decided to start heading back into the valley as the car park here was already full as it was a Saturday.
&lt;p>On the way we stopped off at Tunnel View again, this time the lot was full and there was a queue. People were just sat in their cars eating which was kinda frustrating as most people just wanna take a few pics as this is probably the most photographed spot of Yosemite. We carried on a couple hundred yards and luckily there was loads of parking spaces long the road so we stopped there and walked back up. We both had our photos and then we got a photo taken of the both us.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
After a quick stop we got back in the car to go back to our tent for lunch which consisted of muffins.. The traffic started to build to a crawl, and after a while we saw signs saying lane closed as there were flood warnings. It took us nearly an hour to get through it all and in to the campground. We thought it was best to stay here for a while as it was way too busy to get anywhere.
&lt;p>At around 4pm we went off to the shuttle stop because we thought the traffic would be too bad to drive in. 3 buses full later we decided to give up and just drive as there was no chance we&amp;rsquo;d get on a bus anytime soon. Not such a good idea as the traffic was still really bad. We drove to the Ahwahnee Hotel, which is where Stanley Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;The Shining&amp;rsquo; hotel was modelled on. We walked around and saw the huge fireplace and the creepy looking elevators. As we were leaving we heard some Americans chatting, saying that Prince William and Kate should come stay here on their tour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then went to Yosemite falls, the highest waterfall in the US and the 6th highest in the world (2425ft). We chose to do the 0.5m walk just to the lower falls as it was around 5pm and were getting hungry. This is a definite must do!! We got to the falls and it was so loud and the wind and spray was freeeezing!&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
It was really busy which kinda sucked but we got some pictures before spotting people on the rocks right up to the waterfall. So yeah we decided to do the same.. which was amazing! We climbed over the rocks and were absolutely soaked through but was well worth it. Once we got back down we could finally hear again and as we were walking back to the car we were getting some odd/worried looks.
&lt;p>We got back to the tent to change in to some dry clothes before heading out to Curry village for some pizza. We paid $20 for a 16inch pizza. Was pretty busy here so had to eat it at our tent, with a warm beer thanks to the bear boxes getting so hot. After the feast of pizza we headed to bed early again at around 10pm. Could&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot longer here exploring but off to San Francisco tomorrow which we are both excited about!!&lt;/p>

After getting ready we headed straight for McDonalds to get a 85c Super Large Coke which is soo good value, and 2 sausage mcmuffins. We then started the drive along the 395, alongside the Sierra Nevada&amp;rsquo;s which we&amp;rsquo;d soon be crossing. On the way we stopped off at Mono Lake.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/w4EA3LGhevfGgP4CABSmRg?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-awPYShNnF3c/ThqivWlbk7I/AAAAAAAAALc/H9z5Nzndw0Q/s400/IMGP1135.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
It contains 78grams of salt per litre and is full of Tufa towers. To put that into comparison the sea has around 35grams per litre. We snapped some pics before getting on the Tioga Pass which would lead us into Yosemite.
&lt;p>The pass reaches an elevation of 9943ft over the Sierra&amp;rsquo;s so there was quite a lot of snow and the temp was a lot cooler in the low 60s. The views along the road were amazing, and the water in the lakes/rivers was so clear. We stopped at Toulomne Meadows where we went to the shop and had a little walk.&lt;/p>

It was a lot busier here than any other national park. We drove down in to the Upper Pines campground, and as we were registering the ranger talked to us about bears and how we were to store our food etc before Jon signed the form to show that we had been informed. She told us that on this very morning there had been a bear incident in our campground! This campground was the busiest we had seen, although our spot was a big one but was mainly in the sun so we only really used a quarter of it. We set up camp and were both feeling realllly tired by the end of it.
&lt;p>We decided to drive to Curry village to see how much firewood was. Unfortunately it was something like $9 so thought we may as well just use our charcoal and have a bbq instead. We decided to take the shuttle to Yosemite village to have a look in their shop, which was a bit bigger but pretty much the same. The shops were very over priced, so we ended up buying some ice cream, breakfast sausages and rolls for our barbecue. The sausages were brown sugar and honey flavor but they were the only ones for less than $5. We went back to the campground and started the barbecue which was so much better than the one we had at the Grand Canyon!&lt;/p>

We managed to cook 4 sausages at a time, and they were alright.. well I began to feel sick they were too sweet for me but Jon managed to eat them OK. We were knackered by the time we were done and played a few card games whilst drinking beers. We headed to bed at about 9pm lol as we were falling asleep and planned on waking up at 6am so we could get out before all the tourists were around and to hopefully spot a bear...

So we quickly showered and packed, then popped across the road to Caesar&amp;rsquo;s to the gift shop. Had to wait for it to open at 10 and bought a few things. We returned to the hotel and checked out. We found out last night that there was a shopping center which had the 50% of red line sales out of town called town square, so decided we&amp;rsquo;d head there before hitting the road. Started off by driving north up the strip instead of south, but once we had turned around it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to get there. It was really quiet, and we stopped in Hollister first. There were a lot of empty shelves so we were glad we had bought so much back in Flagstaff. Jon managed to get a couple more things though. We went to A&amp;amp;F but the 50% off part was rubbish so didn&amp;rsquo;t get anything. Also pretty much everything that wasn&amp;rsquo;t on sale had a tag on it saying &amp;ldquo;not for sale&amp;rdquo;, weird. We then filled up the tank and bought some snacks, making sure we had enough to get us through Death Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We drove the &amp;rsquo;local&amp;rsquo; route, passing through Pahrump and into the valley.&lt;/p>

We were now in California where we will stay for the rest of our trip. The temperature was starting to rise, although in the distance were big rain clouds. The views were amazing, and we stopped off at Zabriskie point for our first view over the valley. It was a short walk up a hill to the viewpoint, totally worth it though and we snapped some pics at the top. The sun was really hot, but we were expecting it to feel alot hotter, we must be kinda getting used to it I guess lol. We got back in to the car, and decided we'd take the drive down to Badwater Basin, the hottest, driest and lowest place in the US (282ft below sea level)! The temp reached a max. of 116 even with clouds around. We arrived at Badwater and it felt alot hotter here. There were quite a lot of people about which felt good, wouldn't wanna be here on our own incase anything happened! We were suprised to see a pool of water here, but apparently that's the reason this is called badwater - as a man tried to get his mule to drink from the water but it refused. The salt flats were so white and you could see the heat radiating off the floor. Took some pics as we walked out onto the flats, started to get really hot so decided to walk back to get in to the air con.

Back on the road, we headed off to artist's drive, a one-way road which was pretty fun - lots of dips and turns. Stopped at artist's pallette where there are so many different colours on the rocks. We continued to drive through Death valley before stopping off at Stovepipe Wells to fill up on drinks. For me Death Valley is a definite must do - the scenery is awesome and the whole drive has been the best so far.

Heading out of death valley and up over the mountains the temp was beginning to drop. Funny moment when a pickup truck overtook us and a guy was sat in the back looking like a hillbilly. The clouds were getting closer and then it started to rain in the desert! We saw signs for flooding so were a bit worried but luckily it wasn't too deep so could drive through fine. Passed through Lone Pine which looked like a cool town, from here you can see Mt. Whitney  the highest point it the US at 14505ft. Crazy to see the lowest point then the highest within a couple hours! After a long driving day (around 360miles) we arrived in Bishop and looked around for a motel. Sat in our room now at TownHouse Motel, it's like a granny cabin but quite big for the price.
We have now passed the 2000mile mark today. Don't like to think we are over halfway now... have so much more to look forward to - off to Yosemite tomorrow! May not have internet then till the 10th when we'll be in San Fran :D Hopefully by then we'll have seen a bear(but not too close), fingers crossed!

On our way there I got a bit nervous and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t helped by the fact that when we pulled up outside there was a protest going on against the Gun Store.(Crazy mexicans)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decided on the Gun Store package which was to shoot a Sig Sauer P226 and a H&amp;amp;K MP5, 2 targets and a T-shirt for $99. We paid and then noticed the queue which was HUGE. It took us about 2 hours to get to the front, we filled the time by spying on other peoples conversations (quite interesting one behind us with a woman doing a similar trip to us and then chatting about what guns they owned..to put it in perspective the one lady was short and skinny and the other was a 16 year old girl&amp;hellip;). Was definitely worth the wait, really enjoyed it. People were super friendly and couldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it more don&amp;rsquo;t be nervous you should do it. I can tell even Sarah was thinking about having a go. As you can see from her trigger finger happy photo :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By the time we were out and back at the hotel it was 2pm. It was Sarah&amp;rsquo;s turn to choose what to do, and she decided to hang out at the Flamingo pool. On our way we stopped at O&amp;rsquo;Sheas and got a $3 beer and hot dog each. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring outside beer into the pool area though so had to down it outside. Went in, grabbed some towels and found some loungers. Was really busy and loads of drunk people about. Funny booty shaking contest at the other side of the pool. We could just hear what was going on which was hilarious, some american lady wooping left right and center and crowds cheering the people on. Went into the pool too which was super refreshing and nice and cold, went under the waterfall (yes it had a waterfall) it was awesome. Sunbathed for the next couple of hours listening to the loud music playing on the speakers. As we were about to leave a big fat man (probably british) was dragged out of the pool by a lifeguard because he was falling asleep in the pool. His incredibly sunburnt friend was trying to get him to leave but he was lying on a lounger swearing at people (funny).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went back to the hotel to shower and get ready to go out for a meal. We went for a wander but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anywhere that we fancied so we went back to our room to look for places that were recommended. Decided on serendipty 3 in Ceasars. Went over and had to wait half hour for a table. Had a really weird waiter, either he had a funny sense of humour or he was depressed and hated his job. On the up side the food was gorgeous, I had &amp;ldquo;the full monty&amp;rdquo; sandwich with steak fries and Sarah had the BBQ chicken pizza. For dessert we shared the frozzzen hot chocolate which is what the place is known for, was totally worth it. Even though we were totally stuffed we managed to pretty much finish it.&lt;/p>

Whilst we were eating it looked like they were setting up a film set with a few cameras and lighting. Will have to keep an eye out for any tv shows, movies or music videos filmed in serendipity 3 las vegas.
Went to watch the Bellagio fountains again and headed back to the hotel via some street acts (Little Elvis, Michael Jackson and las vegas junk drummers who were quite good). Fell straight to sleep which was good as we had a long drive ahead of us the next day.

Managed to be 100 degrees even through a thunderstorm last night. Feeling a bit grotty we decided to head straight to vegas to get showered and to get some junky vegas food. Drove through the Vegas strip and arrived in Las Vegas around 11am then checked our booking and saw check in was 4pm&amp;hellip;Went along and tried to check in, luckily she said we could check in 12.30pm which only left an hour and half before showers and food. Went a bit crazy and blew $1 on the slots, lost it all. We crazy.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SRO7tndKms5KjUAt1WsPqw?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Y09G6J9f1Y4/ThSPnkESgNI/AAAAAAAAAEs/lChDIjvdw1c/s400/IMGP0870.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
Came back and checked in at 12.30, room was nice can see the Bellagio fountains from our room. For $35 it's a bargain location-wize. We finally had our showers, and feeling fresh we decided to get out on to the strip. We went casino-hopping, which meant that we ended up walking more here than we did in Zion or Bryce. We stopped in at: The Venetian, Wynn Las Vegas, Treasure Island, Mirage, Caesar's Palace, Bellagio, NY-NY, Excalibur, Luxor, MGM Grand and Paris.
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/S9Mervf7j5Kmo3fIsh4wig?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ii-PBNcn-j0/ThSPo8HRBhI/AAAAAAAAAE0/uFiaYVe3T_Q/s400/IMGP0876.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
The casino's were HUGE, and each of them had something a bit crazy going on. Like The Venetian with it's gondola rides, MGM Grand having a lion habitat and Caesar's Palace's Forum Fountain Show (bizarre!!). Walking from casino to casino wasn't very pleasant - it was so humid. On every street corner there were crazy little Mexican people handing out escort cards. Whenever I refused a card they'd try and offer it to Sarah! Our feet were killing by the time we'd been in them all, and had been walking around till 7.30, so we went back to our hotel room to rest our feet for half an hour. We started to get hungry so had a think of where to eat and decided on the Cheesecake Factory in Caesar's.
&lt;p>At 8pm we left for Caesar&amp;rsquo;s, the whole strip was lit up and the streets were packed. Just before we left we grabbed some dollar margaritas which were half frozen, basically slushies (50% tequila, 29% Triple Sec, 21% fresh lime or lemon juice). Very strong, I think all the soda was frozen and it was just ice cold tequila with a hint of lemon. We headed straight for the cheesecake factory as it was quite late and we weren&amp;rsquo;t sure if we would get a table. Was busy when we arrived but only a 25 minute wait. Spent that in the apple shop using their laptops and free internet hehe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 9.15pm we were seated at our table. We were given the menu&amp;hellip;.400 different choices, luckily they gave us a specials menu which we both ordered from. I had the Salisbury steak with mashed potato. Sarah had the chicken something or other it was nice though. The portion sizes were HUGE Sarah only managed half before she started feeling ill from being so full. That meant I had to try and not only finish my ridiculously huge steak but try and eat her chicken pesto parma ham pasta stuff. I tried&amp;hellip;and failed. The main reason we went was for cheesecake but we were way too full to eat more. We think we might head there tomorrow instead to get some, looks super tasty. We were both super tired after our meal but managed to stay awake to watch the Bellagio fountains, they were spectacular. The final blast was worth the wait, I imagine it takes the 15minutes between shows just to charge up the pumps for the final blast. Was also super cheesy, people clapped&amp;hellip;just like at sunset in the grand canyon.&lt;/p>

We were up quite early this morning and realised that since we were in Utah it was Mountain Time so an hour ahead. A much better sleep here as it was a lot cooler than the Grand Canyon. We packed up the tent and drove over to the general store, where we had showers and washed our clothes. Then off we went for a much shorter drive to Zion. We passed through lots of towns, which were full of US flags and lots of people hanging out in their front gardens. We drove on the Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway which was fantastic! The road was really busy due to it being July 4th and so the parking for the Overlook Trail was full so unfortunately couldn&amp;rsquo;t do that. We drove through the 1.1mile tunnel which was cool, before heading down in to the canyon and in to Zion NP.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AolfhMYn3_fbTQSoLxSyBA?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GfKFrRycnKg/ThSO6teRV8I/AAAAAAAAADE/D6bWW4HDx00/s400/IMGP0790.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
We decided to go straight to Watchman Campground to check-in, but we were told that our site still wasn't empty so had to wait till 12 (about 15mins). So we went in to the town of Springdale, and popped in to a supermarket where we bought bread, cooked sausage, pringles and gatorade. We then went to the campground and put up our tent. We were on site 33, but wished we were on 31 as this had a huge rock and had a lot more shade. The floor was made of gravel, and so when we tried to peg our tent down we were just hitting rock so had to leave it unpegged. After putting the tent up we heard rustling in the bushes and out came a deer! There were loads of ants climbing up our legs so decided to leave and get the shuttle bus in to the canyon as it's closed to cars during the summer.
&lt;p>The shuttle ride was boiling hot, no air con and crowded&amp;hellip; It felt like driving through Jurassic Park the scenery was amazing. There was an audio commentary on the bus, which stated that the sandstone cliffs here were the highest in the world. We got off at the last stop - the Temple of Sinawava. This was where the trailhead for the River Walk began, an easy 2.2mile walk along the Virgin River.&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9YluI-dnQ7TGnohwxnmARg?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4ElhvvfAktM/ThSPBNnJ7TI/AAAAAAAAADg/PUX4lPnQIx8/s400/IMGP0809.JPG" height="400" width="300" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
At the end of the hike the trail for the Narrows begins. We would have loved to do this one, but didn't have the right clothes/shoes. It's a hike through the river, and some points you'd have to swim through. It was very busy here so we quickly got our feet in to the water before walking barefoot to a quieter spot on the way back. There were loads of lizards along the way, and lots of squirrels running along the sand.
&lt;p>We then got the shuttle to Weeping Rock, and walked the 0.4mile trail. We were really hot, the air was so humid. Once we got to the top we were so glad we did this trail. Water was falling off the rock above us and we stood underneath and got soaked - so refreshing!&lt;/p>
&lt;table style="width:auto;">&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TiIwGeTYS6wsqAD0N6FX-w?feat=embedwebsite">&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Q5DMfhgTHn0/ThSPEtv0eRI/AAAAAAAAAD0/APkVHJELYm0/s400/IMGP0825.JPG" height="300" width="400" />&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From &lt;a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/jonfry22/RoadTripUSA?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">Road Trip USA&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
We caught the bus again and got off at Zion Lodge and walked the Lower Emerald Pool Trail (1.2miles) to more waterfalls which were lovely. We were really tired after this, so went back to our tent where we discovered it was half 5 and 100 degrees. No wonder we were feeling so dead! It felt so hot at our site so we decided to get in the car and drive to Springdale. We were feeling a bit hungry so went for food at Wildcat Willies Ranch Grill &amp;amp; Saloon. We both had the Buffalo Meatloaf which was SO good, and the staff here were really nice. We wanted to stay in the cool, but decided to head back as it was getting dark.
&lt;p>We played a few card games, before heading in to our baking tent.. We heard a few fireworks, but sadly no fireworks/fires/charcoal were allowed in the park, they told us it was because of the risk of fire spreading. We managed to fall asleep with the tent open, but was woken up during the night by really loud thunder. It got worse and I had read yesterday to follow the 30/30 rule - if you can&amp;rsquo;t count to 30 between lightning and thunder then seek shelter. Well, after the first bit of thunder that woke us up we saw lightning and only managed to count to 1 before thunder. People were getting in there cars so we made a dash for ours too. Quite embarrasing when after it passed our car alarm went off whilst we were in the car! We decided to get back in to our tent when everyone else did, and managed to get back to sleep. Tomorrow we are off to VEGAS!!!&lt;/p>

Aircon was quite noisy but rather that than frazzle, also noisy german baby grr. Got up showered and had breakfast of the stickiest cinnamon swirls in the world and pop-tarts. After a full re-arrange of the luggage and the boot, we headed off to horseshoe bend. It was a 3/4mile walk through hot sand (only found this out halfway up the hill and I was wearing flip-flops). Got there in the end and was a fantastic view. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t look that big in the photo but if you look closely you can see a boat on the river, and that shows you just how big it was. On our way back we were both dead and Sarah got stung by a mysterious black demon.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5908099952/" title="IMGP0669 by jonfry22, on Flickr">&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6033/5908099952_0e1ba4b2e0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMGP0669">&lt;/a>
We headed off to the Glen Canyon Dam, and stopped off quickly to take some snaps. We weren&amp;rsquo;t there for very long but that&amp;rsquo;s all it took to make us extremely jealous of all the people with boats and jet-skis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next we were off to Bryce Canyon NP. Drove along the scenic byway, saw alot of horses, wild deer and llama things. Arrived at the campground in Bryce, had lost our booking info so didn&amp;rsquo;t know what plot number we were at so had to drive round the whole campground searching for &amp;lsquo;fry&amp;rsquo;. It was on the last loop we checked, so parked up and set up camp. As we were setting up the tent there was extremely loud thunder and black clouds overhead. Read that Bryce is one of the most concentrated lightning storm areas in the US.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We drove down to Rainbow Point and got out for our first look of the canyon. Looked amazing, couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get down into the canyon and have a proper look around. Drove back down the from the top stopping at all the view points.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5908101644/" title="IMGP0728 by jonfry22, on Flickr">&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/5908101644_077eb6af16.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMGP0728">&lt;/a>
Onto the highlight of the trip to Bryce, called the &amp;lsquo;World&amp;rsquo;s best 3 mile hike&amp;rsquo; (Navajo/Queens Trail) we were both pretty tired starting the hike, but within 10mins we were both buzzing down the canyon. Whether that was the gorgeous scenery or the sketchy american energy drink we had, its anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess.. (the drink&amp;rsquo;s ingredients were a list of e-numbers + caffeine). After we got down the steep part of the hike it started to rain pretty heavily for a bit so alot of people returned back up. So glad we didn&amp;rsquo;t, and it meant not many people were out walking. But its safe to say it was an amazing hike, couldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it more, was the best day so far in the U.S. Seemed like every photo was a great photo and round every corner was something that would make you say &amp;ldquo;WOWWWWWW&amp;rdquo;.

Went back to the tent for a rest and headed straight out to the general store for some food. Didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything that we fancied so went back to the tent for a hearty dinner&amp;hellip;Cap&amp;rsquo;n Crunch with warm milk. Mm mm mmmmmmm. It took all of one spoon to make me ditch it and have a pop tart. Black clouds were looming overhead so were doubtful we would wake up dry. Tomorrow onto Zion, fingers crossed in one piece.&lt;/p>

So I snoozed it for 10mins but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get back to sleep so decided to have a look at the sunrise info. which is when I realised I had set the alarm an hour early. Luckily Jon had already fallen back to sleep, but unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. The people in the pitch next to ours were up and I could hear them packing their tent away. I decided to look at a map and plan out where we&amp;rsquo;d go for sunrise. I read that Yaki Point was a good spot, but this was only accessible via shuttle bus and the last bus before sunrise was at 4.45am. So I woke Jon up at about 20past and we rushed to get ready in time. We drove down to the visitor centre where we&amp;rsquo;d catch the bus, but only had 1min to get from the car to the bus in the dark with no clue where we were. We were running around trying to find it and fortunately got there just in time. The sunrise was beautiful and a lot quieter than sunset, with just a couple of photographers set up. My camera battery only had 1 bar left so couldn&amp;rsquo;t take many pics/videos.
&lt;a title="IMGP0606 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5895655027/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5277/5895655027_9e86e44778.jpg" alt="IMGP0606" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>
We caught the bus back to the car and proceeded to the campground where we began to pack up. We had begun to live out of the boot with one suitcase practically empty so had to organize it all as there wasn&amp;rsquo;t really any space left. It took a while to get the tent down and packed and sort our stuff out, but we finally hit the road at 7ish. We were looking out for elk and mountain lions but didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to spot any. We drove on long stretches of 2 lane highways, heading NE towards Monument Valley. We stopped off at a town called Tuba City at a McDonalds. There were a lot of Navajo people around here. We bought 3 sausage mcmuffins, a hash brown and a large coke for $5, and used the free wi-fi. We filled up on gas, and drove on before stopping for a toilet break at McDonalds in Kayenta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Off we went again, where we caught our first glimpses of Monument Valley. The temp. was now around 100 so was really hot when out of the car. We crossed the Utah border - making that our 4th state we&amp;rsquo;ve visited. We paid the $5 per person charge to enter Monument Valley, and it was well worth it.
&lt;a title="IMGP0624 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5895655383/">&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6052/5895655383_b0fabe8512.jpg" alt="IMGP0624" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>
The sand was so bright and the views were fantastic. We took loads of pics here trying out different poses, trying to capture a John Wayne pose which we never could really achieve. I mean, what exactly is a John Wayne pose? We popped into the Visitor Center where we learnt about the Navajo tribe and how their native language helped with coding in World War 2.
&lt;a title="IMGP0628 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5895655579/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5316/5895655579_bc0981fb10.jpg" alt="IMGP0628" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>
We couldn&amp;rsquo;t spend too long here as we were so tired from waking up so early and the heat wasn&amp;rsquo;t helping either. We left just before lunch, and stopped at our 3rd McDonalds of the day where we had 20 McNuggets, a sundae and another large coke for just $7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were now on the final stretch of today&amp;rsquo;s journey to Page. The scenery was really good along this route, and we drove along listening to Ricky Gervais&amp;rsquo; Podcasts. Coming in to Page we could see Lake Powell, which is a man-made reservoir and is the second largest in the US. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t made reservations to stay here, and unfortunately alot of places where booked out or quite expensive as it&amp;rsquo;s July 4th weekend. We finally found a motel 6 which was charging a reasonable rate. We put our cases into our room, took a shower then headed to the pool. The water was freezing but so refreshing. We&amp;rsquo;ve just come in from shopping at Walmart, where we bought our dinner and food for tomorrow. It&amp;rsquo;s 94 fahrenheit here and it&amp;rsquo;s 8.30pm, lovelyy.
&lt;a title="IMGP0662 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5896223974/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5316/5896223974_53bde4a479.jpg" alt="IMGP0662" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>
We&amp;rsquo;ll be visiting Horseshoe bend and the Glen Canyon Dam before we go to Bryce Canyon where we&amp;rsquo;ll stay the night. Again, may not be on for a couple of days as camping for the next 2 nights, we&amp;rsquo;ll be in Vegas on the 5th though so will definitely be on then for an update. Not looking good in terms of weather after today&amp;rsquo;s hottest day of the year so far - storms are coming!!&lt;/p>

As we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get back to sleep we decided to get up and have some lucky charms for breakfast. As I was going to the car to get something outta the boot I spotted a deer about 10foot away. We managed to get some pictures as it strolled past our pitch eating the plants, was so cool. We then went for a well needed shower which cost $2 each.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5896221350/" title="IMGP0466 by jonfry22, on Flickr">&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6050/5896221350_53ec0ec850.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMGP0466">&lt;/a>
Once we were ready we jumped in the car with 2ltrs of water and a few crisps we had left over. We drove and parked at the Bright Angel Trailhead. By this time it was 8.45am and the sun was already getting hot. As we didn&amp;rsquo;t have much food with us and we&amp;rsquo;d left it quite late we only decided to go as far as the 1.5mile house. The walk down was nice and easy, with quite a lot of spots of shade, as the trail made switchbacks down the canyon travelling along a fault line. There were spectacular views all the way down, with lots of squirrels following us hoping for some food.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5896221612/" title="IMGP0471 by jonfry22, on Flickr">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5156/5896221612_12015d2abe.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMGP0471">&lt;/a>
As you travel further into the canyon the temperature starts to rise so by the time we got there we were starting to feel the heat. They had restrooms and water here so we refilled our bottles before making the ascent back up. We were originally planning on following the trail until the Indian Garden, but as the temp was so high it wasn&amp;rsquo;t advised. Apparently there would be no shade if we carried on further, which did not sound good! The way up was alot harder, but whenever there was a spot of shade we&amp;rsquo;d take a break and have some water. We also passed a group of Mormons which was quite cool. It was around 11am by the time we got to the top, and we felt good that we managed to at least hike a bit into the canyon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were really hungry at this point so we went to the village and had a pizza in the air conditioned building, which made us feel a lot more energised. We then went to the tent and chilled out for a couple of hours. Our tent&amp;rsquo;s in partial shade, and we wanted to stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day. We bought a pack of cards at the shop and played some games (including snap lol), and read some of our books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At around 3.30, we drove out back to the Bright Angel Trailhead to park there as a lot of people park along the road or at the designated car parks. But this spot is as close as you can get to the red shuttle route, with lots of free spaces. We decided we were going to take this bus and jump off at all the points along the way. This route isn&amp;rsquo;t driveable during the summer and so using the bus is the only way (other than walking) to see it all. We stopped off at each point, took loads of photos, then caught the next bus.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5895654369/" title="IMGP0532 by jonfry22, on Flickr">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5234/5895654369_37b5ca0224.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMGP0532">&lt;/a>
The views were breath-taking, and at some of the stops we were the only ones there! Our favourite stop was Pima Point. We continued this all the way to Hermit&amp;rsquo;s rest, before getting the bus back to the transfer stop and driving back to the campground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was about 6pm by the time we got back, so we quickly lit the charcoal. Unfortunately they stopped allowing log fires the day we got here (due to it being summer so dry). We then waited&amp;hellip; and waited&amp;hellip; and decided to put in another firelighter. I think we were kinda impatient, but this was only because it was getting dark and we were trying to boil pasta and the water was still lukewarm 40mins after we started. It was just after sunset by the time it was all cooked, so we wolfed it down just before it was dark. We then headed to sleep as we wanted to be up in time to catch sunrise at 4.14am&amp;hellip; well it was actually 5.14am but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise this yet.&lt;/p>

This was a 50s style diner that the Chinese guy recommended, but we&amp;rsquo;d also seen a couple of tourists wearing t-shirts from there yesterday. I had waffles with bacon and eggs, Sarah had french toast with sausages and eggs. Was funny when the waitress asked how I&amp;rsquo;d like my eggs, and I responded with a blank look (me and Sarah both thinking cooked), turns out scrambled was an acceptable answer. They both came with 2 pots of maple syrup each, so we were stuffed by the time we finished and started us off well for the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then headed over to Fry&amp;rsquo;s Groceries (woohoo!) to do our shopping for camping, we picked up our first beer in America - 30 cans of Budweiser for $17 not bad at all! We bought minced beef, pasta and pasta sauce to cook on the fire (Bad idea..). Then queued to get gas again at Fry&amp;rsquo;s, got hustled out of every space we were waiting for. Not going to argue with a Texan with a HUGE truck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Started the drive to Grand Canyon and what a drive it was. Stopped at Cameron Trading Post about half way through, was a nice place but super touristy and thus quite expensive. On walk back to car to carry on to Grand Canyon noticed a tumbleweed stuck in the grill, thought it would be a good idea to take it out, picked it up and BAM prickle (got swollen boohoo).
&lt;a title="IMGP0615 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5895655185/">&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6007/5895655185_844a19c905.jpg" alt="IMGP0615" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>
We drove along the desert view trail stopping off on all the view points into the Canyon. We stopped for a picnic halfway in the cool of some trees, it was super hot. A lovely American lady offered to take a picture of me and Sarah in front of the canyon and proceeded to say that we were the first English speaking people they had come across for hours. Everyone else seemed to be European.
&lt;a title="IMGP0402 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5895649595/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5279/5895649595_50e1067e89.jpg" alt="IMGP0402" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>
Stayed at Mather campground, really nice, in one of the main loops with good access to water and the toilets. (Aspen Loop, No. 21). Now was the time to set up the tent. Luckily we had a trial run of putting the tent up from the comfort of my back garden. All went pretty smoothly and within 15mins we were in our sauna of a tent. We then chilled out and set up camp properly (got water, had a a beer etc) whilst making plans for the next day. Then we went to Hopi point to watch the sunset, was absolutely stunning and we took a tonne of photos.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5896220954/" title="IMGP0426 by jonfry22, on Flickr">&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6019/5896220954_f9ab134f23.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMGP0426">&lt;/a>
The most American part of the trip was when the sun set and everyone started clapping, classic. We caught the shuttle bus back to camp and was pretty much pitch black by the time we got back, went to sleep about 9pm excited for a proper walk around the canyon tomorrow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always check Flickr for &lt;del>all&lt;/del> most of the pictures.&lt;/p>

We woke up at 8ish and slobbed until around 10, eating pop-tarts in bed. Opened the curtains to see a hummingbird inches from my face, Sarah was jealous. We packed up and checked out around 11 to hit the road. Not as long a drive as yesterday, approx 240miles. We crossed the Colorado river and entered our 3rd state – Arizona. Sarah was map reading so missed the welcome to Arizona sign lol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We took the wrong exit off the interstate and it just so happened to be a truck inspection lane, where they weigh and inspect the goods. We queued with the trucks until we got to the weighing scales and luckily there was a woman in the window. We played the touristy card and said ‘uhh we took the wrong exit.. how do we get to route 66?? Sorry!’. No doubt a funny sight for all the truck drivers that day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stopped off at Walmart in Kingman. It was a huge super-center – bigger than anything in the UK. Wandered round for like 45mins, picking up yet more American junk food (so cheap! 1ltr powerade was 80cents) and filled up the cooler. Then we got on to Route 66 and began the famous drive, wow fantastic views pretty much the whole way.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px;">&lt;a title="IMGP0317 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5886258849/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5156/5886258849_119dd32456.jpg" alt="IMGP0317" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text">Road As Far As The Eye Can See&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
Awkwardly stuck behind a Volkswagen for a while, dithering whether to overtake (we did). Saw loads of tumbleweed but was all too quick to take a photo of. Stopped at a gimmicky shop but didn’t buy anything. It’s a shame route 66 is looking quite run down, but it looks like it’s supposed to be that way.
&lt;div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px;">&lt;a title="IMGP0332 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5886825392/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5271/5886825392_e5a299be20.jpg" alt="IMGP0332" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text">Route 66&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
We hopped back on the freeway at Seligman heading deeper into Arizona. When all of a sudden the landscape changed into forest country. There were warnings for elk and deer. We saw a deer woohoo… shame it was dead on the side of the road. We reached a max altitude of 7500ft and the temps started dropping to a lovely 85.
&lt;p>On to Flagstaff, where we hadn’t pre-booked a motel so pulled into the ‘budget host inn’ on route 66. The Asian guy hardly spoke English and was like ‘you eat? eat?’ whilst taking a bite out of an imaginary sandwich. He was recommending a place for us to go for dinner. After checking in we went for a drive. We ended up at the Flagstaff Mall and Marketplace – where dreams come true. We made a B-line for the Hollister store, and spent the next hour inside splurging $200 on 15 items of clothing. Everything was on sale, with a sale on the sale stuff of 50% (if that makes sense). Sarah bought a t-shirt for just $4.50!&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 385px;">&lt;a title="IMGP0349 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5886824908/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5303/5886824908_13680d5330.jpg" alt="IMGP0349" width="375" height="500" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text">Hollister Tags&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
After returning to the checkout 3 times we thought we better leave before we started to look weird. We headed to Del Taco, and yes you guessed it – we got a taco. It was good, filling food.
&lt;p>Back to the motel now, with a chair propped up against the door. A nervous nights sleep ahead, not helped by CBS warning of monsoons coming this weekend…Grand Canyon tomorrow so may not be on till 1st July when we’ll probably be in Page, AZ.&lt;/p>

So we had some pop-tarts, and packed all our stuff in to the car and headed off. As we left about 3 fire trucks drove past and as we pulled out just down the road from our hotel there was a building on fire. We pulled into our first gas station and tried to do pay at pump using credit card, but it was asking for a zip code (using only numbers) so had to go in and pay cash. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a clue how much, as you have to pay before you pump, so we paid $40 but it only came to $20 for half a tank!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then were onto the interstate and pulled  off along the way to Fry&amp;rsquo;s Electronics. We were looking to buy a kindle, but unfortunately they didn&amp;rsquo;t sell any. Jon nearly wet himself from excitement when we were there because A. It was called Fry&amp;rsquo;s electronics and B. It&amp;rsquo;s just about the coolest computer shop in the world. We decided to head to walmart - and here we bought a kindle! It cost $114 and the case was $35. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome and have put on some guidebooks with maps which shall be helpful.
&lt;a title="IMGP0187 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5883119981/">&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6019/5883119981_c010b10524.jpg" alt="IMGP0187" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>
As we carried onwards the temperature started going up, we were also going up as we were about 3000ft up and it was 100 degrees. We got to palm desert, and were using google directions which unfortunately got us lost and we ended up doing a bit of backtracking till we found the interstate. Along this road were signs advising us to turn off the air con, which we did as we were worried so we had the windows wide open. We pulled off into Joshua Tree NP, our first national park! We drove around and stopped at Cholla Cactus Garden and a few other viewpoints to take some pics, but we were both pretty hot so didn&amp;rsquo;t get out of the car much. The Joshua Trees were really cool and the scenery was gorgeous.
&lt;a title="IMGP0219 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5883122023/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5195/5883122023_432a13872a.jpg" alt="IMGP0219" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then continued to drive on single lane roads, where we didn&amp;rsquo;t see any cars for miles and were just surrounded by desert. Every now and then we&amp;rsquo;d pass some shacks and trailers, and big clumps of mailboxes on the side of the road. It was now 115 degrees so we didn&amp;rsquo;t get out of the car and kept the air con on. We passed salt flats and really long freight trains, and came close to hitting some chipmunks.
&lt;a title="IMGP0268 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5883697226/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5883697226_19a5d52fab.jpg" alt="IMGP0268" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were getting low on fuel but thought we should be fine as we had approx 100miles to do with 150 in the tank. We got a bit worried when the light came on, but then we passed the &amp;lsquo;Welcome to Nevada - The Silver State&amp;rsquo; sign and we only had 5 miles left to drive. We passed a tree full of eagles which was pretty cool, before we headed into our hotel. For £14 a night this place is a bargain, we even had a free upgrade! Tomorrow we will be entering Arizona and driving Route 66!!&lt;/p>

It was going to be our first proper day of sight seeing. Sarah was awake at 0620 and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get back to sleep so was an early start. We got up showered and ready, had chocolate fudge pop-tarts for breakfast filled up all our bottles of water and set off!
First we went to Cabrillo national monument which was an easy drive, really nice and went past some very nice houses. We met our first Ranger who we bought our America the Beautiful pass off, which was $80 and is entry to all the National Parks/Monuments. We parked up and headed to the view point where there were views overlooking the Navy airbase San Diego, views were great and you could even see Mexico in the distance. The airbase is one of the busiest in the U.S and while we were standing there we saw a Jet, a few helicopters, loads of normal planes and two navy destroyers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; align=&amp;ldquo;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;500&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a title="IMGP0039 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5883652262/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5143/5883652262_bbb5b5c58c.jpg" alt="IMGP0039" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a> Me at Viewpoint[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we drove down to the tidepools and sat watching the surfers surf whilst eating some Cheetos.
Moving on, we then went to Old town which is titled the birth place of California. Getting there was quite a problem, we drove round in what seemed like circles, nearly got run over by a train (dodgy crossings) and struggled to find somewhere to park. Was worth all the hassle of getting there though as it really felt like we were in Mehico when we were there. There was live music being played by a cool group of Mexicans, and the food smelt lovely.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dashed off to Balboa park which is the U.S&amp;rsquo;s largest urban park. It was full of museums and a few nice gardens. Coolest thing about it though was the &amp;ldquo;designated dog walking area&amp;rdquo; which looked like a scene from a Disney movie. Dogs running about with each other lol.
Now to Walmart where we did our main shop for our camping supplies. The area wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, from the walk from the car to best buy there was a crazy lady with a trolley talking to herself who I thought was gonna attack Sarah. Then the walk from best buy to Walmart a guy wanted to shake my hand but he looked like a crazy drug addict so we said No thanks and walked off.
We were quite glad to be leaving that area and heading to the Coronado bridge. Its one of the top 3 suicide bridge in the U.S after the golden gate bridge. Driving over it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too fun, roads felt tight and the locals seemed to totally ignore the speed limit and gun past us at 80 when the limit was 55. Got some good pics though and a cool video (will try to upload at some point, its 720p though so its huge).
We went to Coronado beach with the Hotel Del Coronado. Was an awesome hotel, right over the beach and was huge! Truly American beach with volleyball and surfers. Stayed here for a while and put our feet in the pacific ocean for the first time. Even though the air temp was 35, the sea was ICE cold.
At this point we were knackered so we headed back to the motel to crash out for an hour. Got hungry so we headed out to the&lt;span style="color: #000000;"> &lt;del datetime="2011-06-29T16:32:55+00:00">Jack Bauer&lt;/del> &lt;/span>&lt;a title="Karl Strauss" href="http://www.karlstrauss.com/index2.html" target="_blank">Karl Strauss &lt;/a>bar and grill/ microbrewery. Was a lovely place would definitely recommend. We both ordered a no frills cheeseburger. Sarah got a Karl Strauss amber larger, and I had a Scott Tiger&amp;rsquo;s IPL or IPA I don&amp;rsquo;t remember but it was good beer and won a world lager competition. Yeehar!&lt;/p>

Woke up today at 7.30am after a good catch up of sleep. First thing to do was shower, so off I went and after about 10mins I gave up. We could not work out how to turn it on. We searched everywhere for a way to turn it on. But nothing, so I had to wash in the sink. We had complimentary breakfast which was nice. Bagels and cinnamon swirls things. At 10am we had a free shuttle lift to Alamo where we picked up the car nice and easily. We were told to choose a compact car out of a selection, and could see lots of Chevrolet&amp;rsquo;s but Jon spotted a one and only ford focus and was quick to say this was the one. So we jumped in and set off. As soon as we pulled out we spotted our first odd sight - a hobo with a trolley dancing in the middle of the road!!

So I snapped a photo, and we managed to get on the freeway pretty easily with no problems. Jon was quite nervous to start but soon got used to it, and now wants an automatic lol.
 
We drove through Long Beach and the OC (Laguna, Newport and Huntington Beaches). All nice scenery with lots of surfers and expensive looking cars.

&lt;p>We got to our motel in downtown San Diego at approximately 3pm, and were quick to have a glass of water as we hadn&amp;rsquo;t drunk since that morning. After a little lie down, we decided to head downtown to Horton Plaza. We went to A&amp;amp;F but was a bit too expensive, so we went for a walk down 1st St. We ended up at the convention center and then the lively Gaslamp Quarter, where there were lots of bars and restaurants. A bit further up were a few shops where we made a few purchases - Jon a t-shirt and I got a vest. We bought some Mountain Dew and Cheetos as we walked back to the motel. I put some pics on the laptop and we paid $3 for wifi.
 
We then made some plans for tomorrow before we headed out at around 8pm to Mission Beach.

&lt;p>It was very lively with loud music and lots of police everywhere. We went on to the beach and took some piccies, was quite cold though so we picked up 2 giant slices of pizza to take back to the motel. Such good timing as we got back at 8.50pm and the new season of True Blood was premiering on HBO at 9pm :D So we watched that whilst eating our pizza.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Funny things:  Heathrow airport, women asked what our relationship status was, I said couple, she asked if we were married i said no, she laughed. Then went and told all her colleagues her apparently hilarious story&amp;hellip;WEIRD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; align=&amp;ldquo;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;500&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;Plane Food&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a title="IMGP0256 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5875426260/">&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5275/5875426260_7ec4651039.jpg" alt="Plane Food" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our flight from Heathrow was delayed from 1005 to 1115. If we had just been flying to J.F.K this would have been a minor annoyance but seeing as we had a connecting flight within an hour and a half from landing this was not good. The actual flight to J.F.K from heathrow was nice, Sarah&amp;rsquo;s first time on a jumbo jet and first time going on a plane with screens. Was great watched a few movies and watched some TV shows they had. Overall just as good as I thought it would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; align=&amp;ldquo;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;500&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;View from the plane&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a title="IMGP0268 by jonfry22, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonfry22/5874872007/">&lt;img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6009/5874872007_37d08e07a8.jpg" alt="View from the plane" width="500" height="375" />&lt;/a>[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we landed we had already missed our 1500 connecting flight to LAX.We picked up our luggage as usual, went through customs fine but as I walked through, heard a customs officer say &amp;lsquo;ill take her&amp;rsquo; point at sarah then lead her away and proceed to search through her whole bag. Sarah the terrorist&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then had to wait a half hour or more to find out if we would be put on the next flight. They said we were booked in for the 1700 flight which wasnt too bad. Re-checked in our luggage, by this time there was a HUGE backlog of luggage waiitng to be put onto the conveyor belt(this would cause problems, more later..).
Had a nice 10 minute wait till boarding our flight to LAX, got to wander through JFK (pretty nice airport) and can now say we have been to New York for all of a few minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run out of time to write anymore on what happened on day 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quick tip of the day: Go to the toilet on the plane before you get food, the queue after is devastating.&lt;/p>

So unbelievably excited not sure if i&amp;rsquo;ll sleep a wink.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Flight details for tomorrow:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(10:05) London Heathrow to New York JFK: KL9085&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(15:00) JFK to Los Angeles LAX: KL5114&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can use a site such as &lt;a title="Flight Stats" href="http://www.flightstats.com/go/FlightTracker/flightTracker.do" target="_blank">Flight Stats&lt;/a> and enter &amp;lsquo;Delta&amp;rsquo; as the airline and the flight number is just the 4 digit number e.g. KL9085 flight number would be 9085. Quite a good website, get to see our plane fly across the map with current altitude and speed(around 600mph I think).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enough jibber jabber, Off to bed.&lt;/p>

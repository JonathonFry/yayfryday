<em>Photo credit: Neil Thomas Douglas</em></p><p>Hoorah we are married! It was a dream come true to marry Jon surrounded by our family and friends, and we both had such a fun day - it really was the best day ever for us. I thought I&rsquo;d share some of the details here and a big thank you to everyone for being a part of our special day.</p><p>Some photos of our wedding progress leading up to the day (will share some wedding photos soon)..</p><p><img src=/images/2016/04/Artboard-3.png loading=lazy alt="wedding progress">

I wrote <a class=link href=http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/ target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a> about choosing our wedding venue, <a class=link href=http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/ target=_blank rel=noopener>House for an Art Lover</a>. It was perfect for our relaxed wedding, and the team (in particular Robert) were excellent and made sure the day ran smoothly.
We stayed nearby to the venue the night before - Jon with his groomsmen <a class=link href=https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/7834217 target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a> and I stayed with my bridesmaids <a class=link href=https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3345932 target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>. We all went for dinner the night before which was nice for everyone to meet properly before the wedding. Both houses were Airbnbs and were excellent, and great for getting ready in the morning.</p><p>######The Bride
I chose <a class=link href=https://www.maggiesottero.com/maggie-sottero/farah/8230 target=_blank rel=noopener>my dress</a> last summer, which I wrote about previously <a class=link href=http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2015/10/30/wedding-progress/ target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>. I found and tried on the dress in Cardiff (it was on display in the bridal shop window), but I bought it from <a class=link href=http://emma-roy.co.uk/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Emma Roy</a> up here in Edinburgh. I wanted a dress that was quite simple (not big!) and light, and I loved the detailing to the the top and back. My fittings weren&rsquo;t until the month of the wedding, but luckily it didn&rsquo;t need any alterations except the hem and I had a bustle added in so the train could be lifted for dancing.
I skipped a veil and jewellery since the dress had enough detail with sparkles and pearls, and I wore <a class=link href=https://www.rainbowclub.co.uk/harlow-peep-toe-satin-shoe target=_blank rel=noopener>Rainbow Club</a> peep toe shoes that I picked up in John Lewis. My hair and make up was done by Lyn Mckenzie and it was exactly what I was looking for - simple and fresh with a pink smokey eye. Lyn also did two bridesmaids and my mum&rsquo;s hair.</p><p>######The Groom
Jon wore a suit from <a class=link href=http://eu.suitsupply.com/en_GB/suits/lazio-blue-plain/P4123.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Suitsupply</a>. He ordered a couple of different ones online and decided on the navy Lazio which fit great and he looked fantastic on the day. He wore <a class=link href=http://www.dunelondon.com/boycy-punch-hole-and-toe-cap-detail-leather-shoe-0272507490002511/ target=_blank rel=noopener>tan shoes</a> from Dune, a <a class=link href="http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Brown-Contemporary-Belt/40966,en_GB,pd.html?cgid=Mens-Belts-braces&start=0" target=_blank rel=noopener>leather belt</a> from T.M.Lewin, and a <a class=link href="http://www.asos.com//Asos/Asos-Slim-Tie-In-Pink-Marl-Effect/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=5983749" target=_blank rel=noopener>blush pink tie</a>, <a class=link href="http://www.asos.com//ASOS/ASOS-Silk-Pocket-Square-In-White/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=5303730" target=_blank rel=noopener>white pocket square</a> and <a class=link href="http://www.asos.com//Asos/Asos-Tie-Bar-In-Slim-Fit/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=4315199" target=_blank rel=noopener>slim tie bar</a> from ASOS. Oh and also some <a class=link href="http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Navy-Pink-Large-Spot-Socks/55573,en_GB,pd.html?cgid=Mens-Socks-boxers&start=0" target=_blank rel=noopener>navy and pink polka dot socks</a> to finish it all off!</p><p>######The Decor
Since the venue was so beautifully decorated with lots of detail already we didn&rsquo;t need to do much in terms of decor. The colours we were going with were grey, navy and blush/peaches. So <a class=link href=http://www.littlebotanica.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>the flowers</a> were made up of peach and blush roses with small white tete-a-tete daffodils (Jon & I are both welsh and wanted to incorporate some welsh things - also they smelt amazing), the groomsmen were in navy suits and the bridesmaids in grey dresses. For the tables we had white roses in fishbowls (provided by the venue) and on the long top table we had small vases of white daffodils.
All of the DIY bits were made the week before the wedding. I made the table names using <a class=link href=http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/30151035/ target=_blank rel=noopener>IKEA Tolsby frames</a> by hanging handmade origami cranes in grey, pink and cream along with the table numbers at the bottom. We framed an &lsquo;order of the day&rsquo; and made an instagram hashtag (<a class=link href=https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yayfryday/ target=_blank rel=noopener>#yayfryday</a>) sign in photoshop by adapting our <a class=link href=http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2016/02/26/wedding-invites-diy/ target=_blank rel=noopener>wedding invite</a> design.</p><p>######The Guest Book
We had a polaroid guest book, where we used a <a class=link href=http://www.paperchase.co.uk/gifts/home-and-kitchen-gifts/photo-albums-scrapbooks/kraft-medium-slip-in-album-4x6.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Paperchase photo album</a> for guests to slip in a polaroid taken on the Fujifilm Instax 210 (borrowed from my work) and write a note on some kraft cards we had set up with sharpies. We also put some <a class=link href=http://www.gingerray.co.uk/bh-721-photo-booth-props-boho.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Ginger Ray photobooth props</a> around the guestbook and another IKEA frame with instructions on what to do. We weren&rsquo;t sure how well the guest book would go down as we read that often people need encouraging to use them - but people were queueing up to add to it which was great! We now have a book full of photos and messages that we can look back on.</p><p>######The Food & Drink
The venue included a three course reception meal followed by coffee and tablet, and the food was excellent. We also had lots of wine, fizzy wine and soft drinks as part of our drinks reception and with the speeches/meal. In the evening we had a buffet but most of us were still pretty stuffed from the meal to eat much!
Our <a class=link href=http://mimisbakehouse.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>cake</a> was made up of three flavours - red velvet on the bottom, then oreo, and victoria sponge on top - and decorated with buttercream roses on top. The three cakes were bought separately and we purchased a <a class=link href="http://www.windsorcakecraft.co.uk/windsor_three_tier_spiral_stand.html?category_id=275" target=_blank rel=noopener>three tier cake stand</a> to place them on and added a Ginger Ray <a class=link href=http://www.gingerray.co.uk/pp-621-cake-bunting-pastel-perfection.html target=_blank rel=noopener>cake topper</a>. The cakes were delicious and we saved some money doing it this way.</p><p>######The Photographer
We chose <a class=link href=http://www.neilthomasdouglas.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Neil</a> after bookmarking his website a while back. We loved his informal, relaxed and candid style of photography. He was fantastic on the day and we had a lot of comments from people that they thought he was great. We can&rsquo;t wait to see all of the photos - we&rsquo;ve seen a few sneak peeks already and they look fab (the photo at the top of this post is one)!</p><p>######The Dancing
In the evening we had a <a class=link href=http://www.ceilidhminogue.co.uk/ target=_blank rel=noopener>ceilidh</a>. It was so much fun, especially since almost all of our guests hadn&rsquo;t been to one before (including myself), and after the first song the band realised we were definite beginners as it was carnage with everyone going in different directions. After that first song they kept things simple but also challenging enough for us, especially as it got later on in to the night! It kept everyone entertained and we were so glad we chose to have a ceilidh. The band did some DJing as well where they took requests which somehow ended up with the majority of the room doing the macarena at one point&mldr;</p><p><img src=/images/2016/04/IMG_5759.jpg loading=lazy alt="J&S Ampersand"></p><p>######<em>Links</em>

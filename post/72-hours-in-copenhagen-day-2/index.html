We walked a slow loop around the harbour. The Copenhagen marathon was on too so it was very busy but there was a great buzz around.</p><p><img src=/images/2016/06/13301274_10154257166269216_4811036322036796686_o.jpg loading=lazy alt=Nyhavn>

We passed Amalienborg by chance, and were lucky enough to be there just as they were doing the changing of the guard. The Designmuseum cafe was a much needed break - a slice of chocolate cake and lots of water - and we sat outside in the gorgeous courtyard in the sun.</p><p><img src=/images/2016/06/13268396_10154080808191399_6326058895869466461_o.jpg loading=lazy alt=Amalienborg>

We had a sit on the grass by the water whilst watching the marathon runners go past. We walked through the star-shaped military fortress. The buildings were painted red which looked great against the blue sky and we stumbled upon the windmill which was cool.</p><p><img src=/images/2016/06/13243934_10154080808541399_7826212685785392186_o.jpg loading=lazy alt="Kastellet windmill">

It was as expected, with lots of tourists. Next up was Christianshavn - in particular the <a class=link href=http://copenhagenstreetfood.dk/en/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Copenhagen Street Food market on Papir√∏en</a> (this was one of the first places I found when researching Copenhagen). We looked to jump on a boat bus across but it was a 40 minute wait so we walked most of the way with a one stop hop on the metro.</p><p><img src=/images/2016/06/13247810_10154257168239216_2585725961717198208_o.jpg loading=lazy alt=Christianshavn></p><p>There was a LOT of choice at the market and we must have walked 5 laps before deciding on Korean food (bibimbap), followed by nutella cheesecake and vitamin boost juice. All very tasty! The prices were pretty high though, I think I slightly preferred the meatpackers market yesterday. We did get to eat the cheesecake sitting on the edge with our feet dangling over the water, watching the boats pass for around an hour. There was also a duck fight on the water which people tried to split up - they were vicious!</p><p><img src=/images/2016/06/13305236_10154257168284216_4038922425327395377_o.jpg loading=lazy alt="Korean Street Food Copehagen">
<img src=/images/2016/06/Artboard-1-1.png loading=lazy alt="Copenhagen Street Food"></p><p>Feeling rested and full, we were ready to move again and we wandered in to Christiana (aka Freetown Christiana). It was an interesting place to explore, with DIY houses and an interesting mix of people. Christiana is described as a large commune which is regulated by a special &lsquo;Christiana Law&rsquo;.</p><p><img src=/images/2016/06/13247696_10154080942176399_3022751071551111425_o.jpg loading=lazy alt=Christiana></p><p>It was now late afternoon and so we decided it was time to catch a bus to <a class=link href=http://www.tivoligardens.com/en target=_blank rel=noopener>Tivoli</a>. I was super excited about this part of the trip as I love rides and had heard this was a must-do when in Copenhagen. The tickets were quite pricey (we went with the unlimited rides ones), but I think it was definitely worth it. The first thing we did was find the nearest grassy area and had an hour long nap! We needed an energy boost before going on the rides ;). One of my favourite rides was &lsquo;The Roller Coaster&rsquo; - one of the oldest running wooden roller coasters in the world. We went on the Star Flyer at sunset, which had spectacular views swinging round from 80 metres in the air! We ate burgers for dinner and went on all of the rides multiple times (no queues!). We stayed for the light show, which I think is run every night, it was a great end to a fantastic day.</p><p><img src=/images/2016/06/13244085_10154257168574216_6626329116333853420_o.jpg loading=lazy alt=Tivoli>

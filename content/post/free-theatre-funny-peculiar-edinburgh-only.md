This morning I received an email from Show Film First with a link to these free tickets to see <a href="http://www.fctt.org.uk/festival_theatre/event.aspx?evtid=536" target="_blank">Funny Peculiar</a> at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh. Tickets available are either the 29/02/12 or 01/03/12 both at 19:30. The cast looks pretty good - lots of TV stars! Be quick if you fancy going, think tickets will be snapped up.

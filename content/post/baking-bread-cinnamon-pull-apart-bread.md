Bread 2/15: cinnamon sugar pull-apart breadÂ from <a href="http://joythebaker.com/2011/03/cinnamon-sugar-pull-apart-bread/" target="_blank">Joy the Baker</a>

Notes: I used about 3/4 of the sugar stated for the filling and had to do the slicing stage in halves as my kitchen doesn't have enough space. I found it quite fiddly arranging the slices, and I think if I could do them so neatly as shown on Joy's blog it would look a lot better.

Review: so yummy and sweet, we ate half of it just after it came out the oven. However it does takes quite a while to make and requires some patience ;)

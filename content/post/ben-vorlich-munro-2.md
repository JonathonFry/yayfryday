There are 282 Munros in Scotland and this is our second ([Ben Lomond](https://yayfryday.com/post/ben-lomond/) was our first). Ben Vorlich is 985m (3,232ft) high. We parked the car at Loch Earn and followed the trail in almost a straight line up to the top. It was a fairly steady climb, although the final climb is pretty rocky and steep. I was very slow at going down this part!

It was very chilly at the top, which was refreshing after how hot I had felt on the way up.

Just got back from seeing Young Adult at the cinema! Here's a brief bit from IMDb about the storyline of the movie:
<blockquote>"Soon after her divorce, a fiction writer returns to her home in small-town Minnesota, looking to rekindle a romance with her ex-boyfriend, who is now happily married and has a newborn daughter."</blockquote>
I thought it was really good, there's funny bits but it is quite a depressing movie, don't expect a happy ending type! The acting was really good, particularly Charlize Theron (who was actually nominated for a Golden Globe for this film) and Patton Oswalt.

It was pretty busy, but still quite a few spaces left, it's a shame that people miss out when people get the tickets but don't turn up! Looking forward to seeing Man On a Ledge tomorrow thanks to Virgin Media (hopefully we'll get free popcorn as they usually supply us with some!)

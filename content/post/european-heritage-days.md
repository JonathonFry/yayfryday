Just a quick post to let those who may not have heard that this month lots of Heritage sites across Europe are opened to the public free of charge over certain dates. So if you've got no plans over the weekend then how about checking one of the places out.

Here's the links for the UK open days:
<ul>
	<li>England: <a href="http://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/">Heritage Open Days</a> (6-9 September)</li>
	<li>Scotland: <a href="http://www.doorsopendays.org.uk/">Doors Open Days</a> (every weekend in September)</li>
	<li>Wales: <a href="http://opendoorsdays.org.uk/events" target="_blank">Open Doors</a> (every weekend in September)</li>
	<li>Northern Ireland: <a href="http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/EHOD-in-Northern-Ireland-T20666-L1" target="_blank">European Heritage Open Days</a> (8-9 September)</li>
</ul>

Jon and I will be heading to the <a href="http://www.midlothian.gov.uk/info/200131/snowsports_centre" target="_blank">Midlothian Snowsports Centre</a>, where tomorrow you can use the chairlift for free, and going for a walk in the Pentlands. We'd planned on doing a walk here before we found out it was free, so we'll definitely be taking advantage of that and saving our legs a little bit ;p

Will you be making the most of the open days?

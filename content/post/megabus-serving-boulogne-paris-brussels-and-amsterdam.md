I know coaches aren't for everyone but if you're really tight for cash then sometimes it's the only option. I've used <a href="http://uk.megabus.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Megabus</a> many times travelling from Edinburgh back to Cardiff, with a change at London, it's almost a 16hour journey including the changeover. 16hours feels like so long, and it really is being cramped on a bus, but when it only costs us a couple of quid it's the only way we can afford to get back. Flights can be £80 return and that's without baggage, and there's no point even looking at trains! Yes we've had hellish journeys, like when we had to change buses 3 times because they kept breaking down. Then we were placed on a city bus driving on the motorway at literally 5mph till the driver refused to continue, and this being an overnight bus just added to the experience. But, I still wouldn't say I'd never use Megabus again, we got our money back and have used them since with no problems.

Now, today I found out that they are  bringing in services from the UK to Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Boulogne - from just <strong>£1</strong>! Details from the <a href="http://uk.megabus.com/megabuscom.aspx" target="_blank">website</a>:
<blockquote>From Monday 16 April 2012, megabus.com will begin to operate services from the UK to Boulogne, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam with two services per day in each direction.
In addition, there will be two further journeys per day in each direction linking Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.

Through bookings to all 4 new destinations will be available from many points across the UK with a change of vehicle at London Victoria Coach Station. Passengers will require to check in and provide passport information prior to boarding the coach at Victoria Coach Station before departure for the ferry crossing to the continent via either Dover or Ramsgate to either Calais or Boulogne. Regardless of the port of arrival in France, all services will call at Boulogne to pick up and set down.</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's an 8 hour journey from London to Amsterdam, which I don't think is too bad as you'd get to stretch your legs on the ferry. Just wish we lived near London!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What do you think of Megabus? Do you think this is a good deal?</p>

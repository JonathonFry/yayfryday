<a href="http://www.thestand.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Stand</a> are giving away free tickets for Thursday night shows over the next few weeks. Tickets are available in Edinburgh and Newcastle, doors open at 7.30pm and many people have said to get there for this time if you want to sit down. I've never been before so can't comment on what it's like, but looking forward to a (hopefully) funny night out!

Bread 3/15 : olive oil bread fromÂ <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1162642/" target="_blank">BBC GoodFood</a>

Notes: I added a handful of chopped green olives to the dough on top of the 2tbsp olive oil. As others have also commented on the recipe, the bread did go brown quite quickly so I covered with foil and turned down the heat to 210C halfway through. As well as a serrated knife I also need a really sharp knife or a razor blade to score the loaf properly.

Review: Great flavour, could easily make this one again. That's our sandwich bread sorted for the next couple days!

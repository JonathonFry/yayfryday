For our 9 year anniversary Jon took us away up North to Perthshire. It was a surprise trip, that somehow he managed to keep secret. We stayed at a beautiful cabin for 2 nights.

I still can't get over this place. We drank champagne in the hot tub under the stars, ate great steaks, relaxed in the sauna, sat by the fire, and watched deer in the fields whilst in the double roll top bath.

Jon proposed on Saturday morning when the sun was still rising. I was in my pyjamas and wondered why he was wearing a shirt. Though we both knew it would happen soon I was still surprised when it actually happened. We could not stop smiling and spent the rest of the day dancing around. It was better than I could ever have imagined and I am so excited to marry my best friend and become Mrs Fry.

Last week was my Birthday week (hooray!) and I celebrated with a fantastic break in Berlin.

These are some of my favourite things that Jon & I did whilst in Berlin:

![Explore Berlin](/content/images/2014/Feb/Berlin1.png)

**Explore.** The views from the Reichstag dome. Getting our bearings and learning a little history on the free Sandemans Berlin tour. Shopping along Kurfürstendamm. Photoautomat photobooths. Many of the incredible historical sites. The transport system. Valentine's day at the zoo. Trying to use our A-Level German skills. Kreuzberg. Tiring out our feet wandering in the sunshine. Resting our feet with a coffee and cake. 

![Eat Berlin](/content/images/2014/Feb/berlin2.png)

**Eat.** Taking a French step back in time at [Heising](http://www.restaurant-heising.de/Restaurant_Heising/Willkommen.html) (just incredible). Street food. Currywurst. Southern Germany's version of mac 'n' cheese (kässpätzle). Chocolate at Fassbender & Rausch. Wild boar ribs in [Lokal](http://lokal-berlin.blogspot.co.uk/). Burgers in an old toilet at [Burgermeister](http://www.burger-meister.de/). Apfelstrudel.

![Berlinale Berlin](/content/images/2014/Feb/Berlin3.png)

**The Film Festival.** Berlinale. Seeing the most bizzare French film. Discovering we had tickets to an international premiere. Pretending to be celebrities walking down the red carpet. [Boyhood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/). Applauding the director and cast on stage. The buzz around Potsdamer Platz. People watching. 

*Berlin, you were so good to us.*

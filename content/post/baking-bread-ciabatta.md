Bread 9/15: Ciabatta from Paul Hollywood's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/140881949X/ref=rdr_ext_tmb" target="_blank">How to Bake</a><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/eight-strand_plaited_57815" target="_blank">
</a>

Notes: Followed the recipe exactly. I used a hand whisk with dough hook attachments as Paul advises against using your hands because the dough is so sticky.

Review: Light and soft with a crisp crust - lovely. Great toasted, spreaded with hummus and topped with sausages for breakfast! Will definitely be baking more of these.

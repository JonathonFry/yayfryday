I just bought a couple of little things to make it up to a fiver and it worked for me so is actually live now. That's a necklace, ring and pen for free - not bad! I had to use my boyfriend's account though as mine no longer works because paypal sucks and they keep saying they'll fix my account but after a few weeks I've given up on them...

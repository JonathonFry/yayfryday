At the end of August Jon and I went on a trip up north to Glencoe.

Neither of us had visited Glencoe before. On the drive up I read a bit about the history (the massacre of Glencoe) and we planned what we were going to do. We had picked out a walk the day before ([Buachaille Etive Beag](http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/buachailleetivebeag.shtml)) that would cover two munros.

The drive in to Glencoe was fantastic. We arrived at the tiny campsite and quickly pitched our tent. There was a crazy amount of midges, and so there was a lot of running around and flapping about. As soon as the tent was up we ran for the car and headed straight to Glencoe village for some midge repellent. I counted 21 midge bites on my face alone...

Since we were quite tired after the terror of the midges, we decided we'd go for a drive down the Glen Etive minor road to Loch Etive. It was a lovely drive (this road featured in Skyfall) and we stopped off along the way to enjoy the views. We ate lunch at Loch Etive and we didn't encounter any more midges.

After arriving back at our tent after eating dinner we settled in for the night. We then realised that we had left our bag full of our clothes and toiletries back at our flat!! So we had no walking clothes with us... so no munros were to be bagged the next day :( I think it must've been really early when we fell asleep as we were both wide awake at 6am ready to start the day.

We packed up the tent and headed straight to the car park by the three sisters. We hiked up to the lost valley which was really fun and quite a scramble! We spotted an eagle circling up high too. It was a great walk and we were the only people there. We were back at the car by 10:30 and on the road to Edinburgh shortly after.

We had a great time and discovered lots of great spots for wild camping in future. Next time we will remember to bring our bag with us so we can do some munro walking!

After almost a year since our wedding day we finally got around to getting a wedding album. We wanted to get something special and chose to go with the layflat album from [Artifact Uprising](https://www.artifactuprising.com/). It was pricey but the quality is excellent, and we bought it together for our one year 'paper' anniversary.

We picked out our most favourite photos of them all and chose at most one photo per page (with some photos filling a two page spread). I am so pleased with how it came out.

I've just ordered another album that I'm currently waiting on, a small soft cover album of our honeymoon. Next step is to get at least one framed print from our wedding in our home. Hopefully it won't take me another year to do.

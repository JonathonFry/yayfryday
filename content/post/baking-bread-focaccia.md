Bread 13/15: [Focaccia](http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/535456/paul-hollywood-s-focaccia) from Paul Hollywood's [How to Bake](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/140881949X/)

Notes: Followed the recipe. The ingredients list states 140ml olive oil but the recipe only mentions 40ml, so I used 40ml where it stated and didn't measure any more out just drizzled lots on top before and after baking.

Review: Yet again a recipe from Paul Hollywood and yet again it is excellent! Seriously, this is one of my favourites so far. I can't wait to turn this in to a sandwich for lunch tomorrow (if it hasn't all been eaten by then).

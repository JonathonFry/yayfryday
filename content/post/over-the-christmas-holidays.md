The holidays are now over for me as I have travelled the 400 miles back to Edinburgh from Cardiff, boo. Time to get back into Uni mode and get through this final push. I'm feeling <em>excited</em> but anxious about graduating this summer. But enough about that, the last 2 weeks I've spent back home in Cardiff have been awesome and I wanted to share a few photos of my holidays :)

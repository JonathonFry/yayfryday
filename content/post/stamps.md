My latest craft addiction. It started with [this fantastic book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Impression-Designing-Creating-Artful/dp/1454701250/) and then [this stamp making set](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Speedball-Speedy-Carve-Stamp-Making-Kit-/dp/B000BYXF4S). 1 week ago I had never made a stamp before and now I've made 6. I need to buy more rubber blocks...

Just hopped into bed at 9pm...No i'm not ill just trying to catch some sleep before waking up at 3.45am to catch our flight to L.A. So unbelievably excited not sure if i'll sleep a wink.

Flight details for tomorrow:

(10:05) London Heathrow to New York JFK: KL9085

(15:00) JFK to Los Angeles LAX: KL5114

Can use a site such as <a title="Flight Stats" href="http://www.flightstats.com/go/FlightTracker/flightTracker.do" target="_blank">Flight Stats</a> and enter 'Delta' as the airline and the flight number is just the 4 digit number e.g. KL9085 flight number would be 9085. Quite a good website, get to see our plane fly across the map with current altitude and speed(around 600mph I think).

Enough jibber jabber, Off to bed.

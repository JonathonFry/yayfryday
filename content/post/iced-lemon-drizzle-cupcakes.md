Today I baked these yummy iced lemon drizzle cupcakes as I had some lemons that needed using. I had roughly 115g of caster sugar left so I used that amount to judge how much other ingredients to use. I forgot that I'd need some more caster sugar for the drizzle but I used soft brown sugar instead and it tastes just as good.

I made 9 cupcakes from the mixture, and had a bit of icing leftover. I also threw in a handful of poppy seeds which adds a bit of texture. The sponge is lovely and moist, and the icing makes them that little bit more special.

For the sponge:
115g caster sugar
115g self-raising flour
115g butter, softened
2 eggs
zest 1 lemon
handful of poppy seeds

For the drizzle:
juice 1 lemon
60g brown sugar

For the icing:
zest and juice of 1 lemon
200g icing sugar

1. Preheat oven to 160C. Beat together the butter and caster sugar until creamy, then slowly stir the eggs in one at a time. Add the flour, lemon zest and poppy seeds and mix together. Place the mixture in 9 cupcake cases and bake in the oven for 30mins.

2. Make the lemon drizzle by mixing together the lemon and sugar. When the cupcakes are baked, remove them from the oven and prick them with a fork. Then spoon the drizzle over each cupcake and leave to cool.

3. Once cooled, make the icing by combining the lemon zest and juice with the icing sugar until smooth. Pour over the cupcakes and leave to set. Enjoy!

On Sunday, Jon &amp; I headed out for the Pentland hills for some hill walking. We haven't been hill walking in a while, and since we are planning on walking up Ben Nevis by next Summer we thought we should get back into it.

We parked up at Flotterstone and did the <a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks Short Route</a>, a nice 10km/3hrs 30mins loop. I always try and print out the planned route before we go - Bing maps have an Ordnance Survey layer which is great and of course free!

The weather wasn't so great - one minute the sun was shining and the next it was pouring down. It was also super windy on the hills. I was almost blown away! The views were fantastic and we shall have to come back to do the 18km route in the future.

On Saturday we completed the 6.4kmÂ <a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/hill-end-trail" target="_blank">Hillend Trail</a> in the Pentland Hills. It's our first 'proper' walk in the Hills and we both really enjoyed it!

We got the ski lift going part of the way up which saved our legs a bit of work. I've wanted to ride on it before and seeing as <a title="European Heritage Days" href="https://yayfryday.com/post/european-heritage-days/" target="_blank">it was free</a> it had to be done. Great views at the top of the slopes too.

How cute are those thatched cottages?! The walk passes through the lovely Swanston village, where apparently Robert Louis Stevenson spent his summer days.

It took us a little over 2 hours to complete the loop, and our legs were aching by the end of it. There were a few steep parts that got our heart pumping. We need to do this more often and would love to do the <a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks</a> walk in the future!

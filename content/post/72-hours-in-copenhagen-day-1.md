+++


Our long weekend trip to Copenhagen began with a flight from Edinburgh with Ryanair. The flights were under £50pp return, and took less than 2 hours (enough time for a couple of podcasts).

We arrived around 10pm and bought a 72 hour city pass, which came in really handy, and used this to get the train to Copenhagen central station. After a short walk, passing lots of restaurants and bars filled with people sitting outside, we arrived at our [Airbnb in Vesterbro](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3575856), just off the pretty 'small Paris' Værnedamsvej. The apartment was lovely and our host gave us some great recommendations. We crashed out not long after, looking forward to waking up here and dreaming of breakfast.

**Saturday // Day 1**

We started the day at [Granola](http://www.granola.dk/). It was at the end of the street we were staying at, and I'd read about it online and in the lonely planet guide so it seemed a good first spot for breakfast. It was pretty early and already very busy; we had seats at the bar with a view in to the kitchen. I went for Skyr with honey and granola and Jon chose scrambled eggs with rye bread. Since it was so busy we had a very long wait (even for our coffees), and when the food did arrive Jon was missing his bread and it wasn't till we'd finished eating that they brought it out. The food was great but unfortunately the service not so much.

After feeling fuelled up, we popped in to a couple of shops and took a stroll along the three lakes in to town. I've been wanting to buy a [Fjällräven Kånken](http://www.fjallraven.co.uk/equipment/kanken) for a while, and planned a stop in to the flagship Copenhagen store for our trip. I came out with two rucksacks - the Kånken and also the High Coast 24 daypack (for light hikes). Jon encouraged me to get the second ;).

We were right by Trovehallerne and made a stop to wander around the stalls. Everything looked so tasty. We went for a coffee at [The Coffee Collective](http://coffeecollective.dk/the-coffee-collective-bars/torvehallerne/) and our first danish pastries (three Snegls - so good!) at [Laura's Bakery](http://laurasbakery.com/). Wow Danish words are so difficult to pronounce!

With a caffeine buzz we carried on walking in to the centre towards Rundetaarn (the round tower). We paid around £5 for entry, and made the spiral ascent (no steps!) to the top for the views. On our way back down they were getting ready to close as there was a unicycle race to the top starting soon after. We wandered in to a few shops (Weekday, Tiger, etc) and jumped on a bus to the Meatpacking District.

It was around 4ish and we were getting hungry. The sun was shining and there was a great buzz in the market ([Kødbyens Mad & Marked](http://koedbyensmadogmarked.dk/)). We bought some drinks, Belgian fries and Vietnamese spring rolls from the stalls and sat on the benches listening to music and people watching. Our Airbnb host recommended this market and we were so glad we went.

A short walk back to our apartment and we ended up napping for an hour or so, before freshening up and catching a bus out to [Höst](http://hostvakst.dk/host/) for dinner. We made a reservation a few weeks ago and we were super excited to try new Nordic cuisine. We decided to treat ourselves to 'An Evening at Höst', which came with wine pairings and lots of surprise dishes in between courses. The food was incredible and the atmosphere was beautiful. We caught a bus back to our apartment and slept very well!

Tomorrow was a visit to the colourful Nyhavn, and a LOT of walking, food and spinning around in the air.

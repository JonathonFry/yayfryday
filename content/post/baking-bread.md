Bread 11/15: Cherry Tomato and Mozzarella Breads from Paul Hollywood's [How to Bake](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/140881949X/)

Notes: I kept to the recipe exactly. All of the breads I've baked from this book have come out fantastically! And if you don't have the book I'm sure this recipe is out there on Google.

Review: The dough is very similar to the [ciabatta](https://yayfryday.com/post/baking-bread-ciabatta/) one, which I loved and have baked multiple times since. This bread came out just as tasty but with the added wow from the mozzarella, tomatoes and oregano. Seriously good and very difficult to not eat it all at once!

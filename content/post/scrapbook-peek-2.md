As you may or may not know, I've been slowly but steadily building up a <a title="A Chilled Out Weekend" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/a-chilled-out-weekend/" target="_blank">scrapbook</a> on my travels around the West of the US last summer. I'm almost halfway through the trip and I've loved making it and reminding myself of all the good memories we had there. I've not done any journalling in it yet as I still don't have an acid free pen, but I think once all the pics and bits are in then I'll go through and fill in all the blanks! It'll be so great to look through in the future.

So here's a little peek at a couple of pages I've been working on recently (sorry about the poor lighting):

<a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2814.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-634" title="usa scrapbook1" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2814.jpg" width="490" height="996" /></a>

And yes that's the <a title="Free Fabric Samples" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/free-fabric-samples/" target="_blank">free fabric sample</a> I got in the last pic there :) If you're interested me and Jon kept a blog whilst on our roadtrip that's over <a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/category/usa-road-trip" target="_blank">here</a>.

Have you been on a roadtrip around the US or planning one? I'd love to hear from you!

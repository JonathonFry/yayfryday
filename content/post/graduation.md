I graduated university on Friday with a first class mathematics degree. My 4 year student chapter is over. I'm going to miss my friends. I'm going to miss having a good timetable which may include a day off and lie-ins or early finishes. I might even miss the bus journeys and the study sessions in the library with frantic last minute revision. It's been a fun 4 years, filled with so many good memories. All of the exams, midterms and projects caused a lot of stress at times, and sometimes I struggled with motivation to study day and night for the weeks leading up to the final exams. But it was so <em>so</em> worth it.

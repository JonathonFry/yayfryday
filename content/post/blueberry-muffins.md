It's been a little while since I last did some baking, but since the new season of The Great British Bake Off has started I've been inspired to get back at it.

I've been eating a lot of blueberries this summer. Finally a berry that Jon will also eat and enjoy! We've been taking blueberries to work with us and eating them with breakfast too. I thought it was about time I baked with them so I bought a bag of frozen berries so that they'd be there ready for me when I needed them. 

I baked blueberry muffins because I love blueberry muffins. Also I don't feel bad about having them for breakfast because they contain fruit and they are a breakfasty thing. Just pretend I didn't put that crumble topping on top.

The simple recipe for the muffins (minus the crumble topping) is from the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/blueberrymuffins_67846).

**Makes 8 muffins**

*For the muffin mix:*

	110g plain flour
	110g butter
    65g caster sugar
    2 eggs
    1Â½ tsp baking powder
    125g blueberries (fresh or frozen (not defrosted))
    pinch nutmeg

*For the crumble topping:*

	60g light brown sugar
    30g plain flour
    1 tsp cinnamon
    30g butter

Begin by creaming the butter and sugar together.

Add the flour, baking powder and nutmeg. Stir together (but don't over mix) and refrigerate for an hour.

Meanwhile, make the crumble topping by mixing together the flour, sugar and cinnamon, then rub in the butter with your fingertips.

Once the hour is up, fold the blueberries in to the muffin mixture. Place a spoonful of the mixture in each paper case, and then top each with the crumble.

Bake in an oven set at 200C/400F/Gas 6 for 20 minutes, or until golden on top.

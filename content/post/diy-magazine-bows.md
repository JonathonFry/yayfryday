For Jon's birthday I wanted to save as much as possible on little things like wrapping paper. By following these simple instructions <a href="http://www.wholeliving.com/133668/read-wrap-recycle-make-bows-magazines" target="_blank">here</a>, I was able to make a bow out of one magazine page. By using the instructions which tell you how big strips to cut etc you can make a bow to add an extra touch to a gift. I just wrapped his presents in brown paper and stuck this on top!

Pretty cute :) I was quite rushed doing this and the loops should be tighter, but I doubt my boyfriend would even notice!

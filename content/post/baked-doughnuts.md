On the weekend I fancied something sweet and spotted a baked doughnut recipe from <a href="http://www.krissys-creations.com/2011/06/baked-doughnuts.html" target="_blank">Krissy's Creations</a>Â on Pinterest. Since I already had all the ingredients I went ahead and baked them. I've never made any type of doughnut before, but these were pretty easy to make and a lot healthier than fried ones. The doughnut holes remind me of mini iced buns!

I don't think they're <em>that</em> much like fried doughnuts in taste and texture, but they're tasty regardless! And I think they look pretty cute too :)

p.s. I used a 2 inch and 3.5 inch round cutter to make the doughnut shapes and kept to <a href="http://www.krissys-creations.com/2011/06/baked-doughnuts.html" target="_blank">the recipe</a>.

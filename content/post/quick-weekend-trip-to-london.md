Jon and I spent last weekend in London. We stayed just one night at [Tower Bridge](http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/united-kingdom/hilton-london-tower-bridge-LONTBHI/index.html) and travelled by train from Edinburgh.

This was our first overnight trip to London together and we planned to eat, see some sights and shop. We did all three in 26 hours, and napped on the train journey home.

Our trip was led by food with the sightseeing and shopping in between. Here's how it went (or skip to the photos below):

Brunch at The Breakfast Club. Prosecco spritzers at Borough Market. A walk along the river to the Millennium Bridge passing The Clink and Shakespeare's Globe. Walk around Westminster to Covent Garden. Burger and shake at Shake Shack. Shopping. Dinner at Rossopomodoro, Hoxton. SLEEP. Breakfast at Jamie's Italian (it came with the room). Second breakfast at the Sky Pod Bar in the Sky Garden. Walk along the river passing the Tower of London and over Tower Bridge. Window shopping. Pizza at Homeslice in Neal's Yard.

I don't know when we'll have another trip to London, but Jon has a work trip there at the end of October and I may have already asked him to bring me back a couple of things. :)

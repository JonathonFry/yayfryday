<a href="http://www.thorntons.co.uk/" target="_blank">Thorntons</a> are giving away free caramel chocolate eggs through facebook. Only one free egg per person and I think they are teeny, but still worth picking one up if you're near a Thorntons this week. Just like it on facebook and give them your email address where they'll send the voucher for you to print. The vouchers need to be redeemed by Sunday!

Making the most of the sunshine again today. Oh we'd love to live somewhere that is sunny all the time... Today we went for a little drive around Holyrood Park, along Queen's Drive. It's a great one-way road with views across the sea to East Lothian and across Edinburgh itself. There are pull outs along the road and we stopped off at Dunsapie Loch. If you're walking up Arthur's Seat this is probably the best place to park up and walk if you're looking for the shortest/easiest route up.

[BTW my camera doesn't like the sun much]

We had a walk about, watched the swans and people passing by. We noticed the same cyclist go by us 4 times in a short space of time, and the loop is 3.3miles up and down, go him!

Now I'm home I think I shall make some <a title="Philly with Cadbury Chocolate Cheesecakes" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/philly-with-cadbury-chocolate-cheesecakes/">cadbury philly cheesecakes</a> (as requested by Jon), watch some TV and think about what to do this week. We are off back to Cardiff next Thursday for 2 weeks - can't wait!!

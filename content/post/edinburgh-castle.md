After living in Edinburgh for over 3 years, Jon and I have finally visited the <a href="http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/" target="_blank">castle</a>! We went when it was free (over St. Andrew's Day weekend) at 9.30 am on Saturday. It was pretty cold up there but luckily there was lots of places to explore indoors too. I really enjoyed it, especially seeing the sparkly crown jewels :) We spent around 2 hours looking around - a nice study break!

Every year it's free to visit over St. Andrew's Day weekend - the best time to go!

These shall be coming to work with me this week. They will keep me away from the doughnuts that keep magically appearing on my desk.

I followed this [Healthy Peanut Butter Chunk Oatmeal Bars](http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2012/10/11/healthy-peanut-butter-chunk-oatmeal-bars/) recipe and added in some chopped up almonds and dark chocolate.

I like that they aren't just crumbly oats like many of the oat bars I make become. These bars also use whole wheat flour which I think is so great as they are more like oaty brownies and they hold together really well. And they are super tasty too.

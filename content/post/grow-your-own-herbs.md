Last week I had a free Â£10 voucher to spend on eBay's Home and Garden category, and I bought an angled palette knife and a herb kit. So today my BBC Gardeners' World Herb Kit arrived. I've wanted to grow herbs on our windowsill for a while now, and getting the free voucher meant I could purchase some!

The kit comes with Chive, Parsley and Basil seeds, compost, tray and these cool pots that you can write on with chalk. I sowed the seeds today and hopefully they will grow so we can use them. Fingers crossed.

Will post up on their progress after a week or so!

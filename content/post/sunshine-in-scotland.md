Yay it's finally been a bit warmer up in Scotland, so after Uni today I wandered in to town to make the most of it. It was apparently 20Â°C today in Edinburgh. I was glad to finally pull out my converse and find some grass to sit on...

<p style="text-align: left;">Gotta love days like this, I can't wait for summer to hurry up now. Just hope the sun sticks around a while longer!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How have you been enjoying this lovely weather?</p>

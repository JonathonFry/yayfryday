I am eagerly awaiting a package, and here's why..

Woo!! I treated myself to some lovely washi tape from <a href="http://freckledfawn.com/" target="_blank">Freckled Fawn</a>. I couldn't resist since it's just been my first payday, and also because readers of <a href="http://aliedwards.com/blog" target="_blank">Ali Edwards' blog</a> were offered free shipping. Perfect timing!

I've browsed Freckled Fawn many times, thinking as it's American and priced in $ the shipping would be expensive. So I went ahead and chose the above three products, coming to $10.05 - paypal charging me £6.66, a great price for these items especially since they are coming all the way from the US. I later found that the shipping would have only cost me $2.30, very reasonable so this would no longer discourage me from buying from over there.

I have wanted to purchase washi tape for a while now, it's so pretty with lots of uses. Here are (some of) my top picks from Freckled Fawn.

<p style="text-align: left;">I am so excited for it to arrive, I have a feeling I will become addicted though; there are so many cute patterns and colours!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Do you own any washi tape? What sort of things do you use it for?</p>

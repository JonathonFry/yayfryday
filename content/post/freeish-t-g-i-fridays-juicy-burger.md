[NOW EXPIRED - JULY 3RD]

<a href="https://yayfryday.com/images/2012/05/juicy-splatdown.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-692" title="juicy splatdown" src="https://yayfryday.com/images/2012/05/juicy-splatdown.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="148" /></a>

<a href="http://www.tgifridays.co.uk/" target="_blank">T.G.I. Friday's</a> are giving away free burgers when you buy any drink via the following link:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><a href="http://games.tgifridays.co.uk/juicysplatdown/" target="_blank">Free Burger Here!</a> </strong><em>(</em>games.tgifridays.co.uk/juicysplatdown)<strong><a href="http://games.tgifridays.co.uk/juicysplatdown/" target="_blank">
</a></strong></p>
To win a burger you have to play the game 'Juicy Splatdown' and finish level 3. It's a whack-a-mole style game, and once you complete round 3 you will either win a burger or be told to try again.

I managed to get a voucher on my second attempt and most people seem to get them on their first couple attempts too. If someone else in your house wants one then I think it may be difficult to get another unless you change your ip, perhaps by tethering with your mobile.

You will be emailed a voucher to print off and bring with you to T.G.I's, then you just have to buy a drink and you can choose a burger from their range. See below for terms and conditions (or via the <a href="http://games.tgifridays.co.uk/juicysplatdown/terms/" target="_blank">website</a>).

Over the weekend I wanted to do some baking with ingredients I still had in my cupboard. And here's what I ended up with...

<a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/souffle.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906" title="souffle" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/souffle.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="734" /></a>

...chocolate soufflés!

I followed <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4351/chocolate-souffls" target="_blank">this recipe</a> from BBC GoodFood, but used 1/3 of the ingredients to serve 2. I used <a href="http://www.greenandblacks.com/uk/what-we-make/bars/cherry.html" target="_blank">Green &amp; Black's Cherry chocolate</a> (still leftover from Christmas!). The mixture filled both of my ramekins right to the top, and so I filled a silicone cupcake case up with the leftovers.

After cooking for around 15mins, they were nice and firm on top but lovely and gooey in the middle! They tasted really good, and it was nice with the pieces of cherries from the chocolate. I think the ones in the ramekins were a bit too much, but the cupcake size was just right!

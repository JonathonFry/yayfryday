I finally have my first ever pair of hiking boots, yay! No more walking up hills in my Hunter Wellies and having sore toes and heels, although they were great at keeping the mud off me. After lots of searching online I went to McArthurGlen in Livingston and tried on a few pairs of boots I'd read good things about. In the end I chose these <a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/womens/viper-womens-boot-p5978.aspx" target="_blank">Viper Women's Waterproof Hiking Boots</a> from Mountain Warehouse.

For me they are super comfortable, the grip is great, and they are leather too which is something I wanted.

On Sunday we went for a walk to Cramond Island, which is a tidal island, to test out my boots. Jon wore  boots which were left in our flat by a previous tenant! I don't think his boots are waterproof though, so he has been looking for new ones and saw they actually do a <a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/mens/viper-waterproof-boot-p7481.aspx?ism=0&amp;cl=BROWN" target="_blank">men's version</a> of mine!!

Luckily the tide was out so we were able to walk across the causeway. It was seriously windy and we could barely hear each other speak. It was a lovely walk with great views of Edinburgh and the Forth Road Bridge. We walked back along the wet beach, at one point I almost got stuck and luckily my boots were tied tight or they might have come off!

I'm looking forward to going for bigger walks in the future and giving these a proper test.

Woah it's been a while... Jon and I moved in to our new flat almost 2 weeks ago and we've only just had the internet installed at the weekend. But hooray we are all settled in and have a long list of TV shows to catch up on! We both love our new place, the kitchen is so big and we made the most of it over the weekend when we had a flat warming - I baked ciabattas and we cooked tapas. And I made these cheesecakes. They were delicious. We had to fight over the last piece.

I've wanted to make baked cheesecake for a while, and had a little look around for recipes and stumbled across <a href="http://apumpkinandaprincess.com/2012/08/mini-snickers-cheesecakes.html" target="_blank">this</a> recipe for baked snickers cheesecakes (I totally copied the caramel sauce and chopped up snickers on top). I adapted it a little and made 2 versions (both with snickers) - Oreo base and Philadelphia, and Digestive base and Cadbury Philadelphia.

I can't decide on my favourite...

Here's how I made them both:



> <strong>Mini Snickers Cheesecakes with Oreo Base</strong> <em>(makes 6)</em>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 cup Oreos</li>
	<li>1.5 tbsp melted unsalted butter</li>
	<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1 egg</li>
	<li>1 snickers bar, chopped</li>
	<li>130g cream cheese</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp vanilla</li>
	<li>optional: caramel sauce</li>
</ul>
1)  Preheat oven to 175C and line a muffin tray with 6 cupcake liners.

2) Crush Oreos and mix with melted butter. Place 1 heaped tbsp in to each liner and flatten down to the bottom of the cases. Place muffin tray in the fridge whilst making the filling.

3) Mix cream cheese and sugar together. Add the egg and vanilla, mixing until smooth. Fold in 1/2 the chopped snickers.

4) Fill the cupcake cups with the filling. Bake in the oven for 22 mins.

5) Leave to cool completely (they sink down after a few minutes out of the oven). Remove the liners carefully, and top with the caramel sauce and the other 1/2 of the chopped snickers.

> <strong>Mini Snickers Cheesecakes with Cadbury Philadelphia </strong><em>(makes 6)</em>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 cup digestives</li>
	<li>1.5 tbsp melted unsalted butter</li>
	<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1 egg</li>
	<li>1 snickers bar, chopped</li>
	<li>130g Cadbury Philadelphia</li>
	<li>optional: caramel sauce</li>
</ul>
1)  Preheat oven to 175C and line a muffin tray with 6 cupcake liners.

2) Crush digestives and mix with melted butter. Place 1 heaped tbsp in to each liner and flatten down to the bottom of the cases. Place muffin tray in the fridge whilst making the filling.

3) Mix Cadbury Philadelphia and sugar together. Add the egg, mixing until smooth. Fold in 1/2 the chopped snickers.

4) Fill the cupcake cups with the filling. Bake in the oven for 22 mins.

5) Leave to cool completely (they sink down after a few minutes out of the oven). Remove the liners carefully, and top with the caramel sauce and the other 1/2 of the chopped snickers.

Enjoy!

Bread 5/15: light and soft dinner rolls from <a href="http://www.mykitchenaddiction.com/2011/05/light-and-soft-dinner-rolls/" target="_blank">My Kitchen Addiction</a>

Notes: Followed the recipe exactly, although I found the dough to be quite sticky so added a touch more flour when I was kneading to stop it from sticking.

Review: Lovely and soft, although I think I'd use less sugar next time as they were a bit sweet for me. Tomorrow we are having soup and these will go down nicely!

p.s. sorry about the lack of posts recently, my laptop wire died last week and after some eBay hassle it's all back up and running again - finally!!

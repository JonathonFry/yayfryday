On Saturday Jon and I went for a walk in the Pentland hills with our friends Natalie and Mike. The sun came out and it was almost 10Â°C so we had to make the most of it! We parked near the ski centre and walked up the steep hill, following the Capital View trail. It was really slippery with ice and mud in places and so we slipped a lot on the way down (Natalie in particular) and once you started sliding it was hard to stop!! We are all planning to invest in walking boots in the future :D

Oh and my legs are still aching... I didn't think I'd make the run today but managed it (just about)!

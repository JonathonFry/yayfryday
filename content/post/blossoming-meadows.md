Spring has definitely come to Edinburgh. On Friday I heard that the cherry blossom had arrived in the Meadows so I made plans to take a walk to the park on Saturday with camera in hand.

We walked to the Meadows via Bruntsfield, with a scrummy stop off at [Cafe Grande](http://www.cafegrande.co.uk/) for a late breakfast. I had a bacon breakfast roll and Jon went for poached eggs on toast, gobbled down with a cup of tea and a cappuccino.

So many pink trees.

And some more.

I recommend a trip to the Meadows for plenty of cherry blossom photo opportunities. Just get there early if it's a sunny day - before the barbecuers descend (or you could join them).

Happy Spring!

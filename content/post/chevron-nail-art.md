My friend Emma lent me her <a href="http://www.modelsownit.com/nails/nail-art-pens.html" target="_blank">Models Own Nail Art Pen</a> in Black so I could have a play with it. I've never tried any of these pen style things before, so this is my first attempt :p So that's my reasoning as to why my lines are so wobbly! I found it had to be squeezed quite hard to get the varnish out, but I enjoyed using it and would love to try out different things with them.

For my nails I used Nails Inc's Palace Gardens Terrace which is a lovely chocolatey brown, and then used the pen on top of it first doing 2 or 3 stripes then a chevron pattern on top. I think they'd look great in Autumn, they aren't very summery like the weather we've been having recently.

Ooh and look - my new ring :) This was one of the free things I got off eBay when they were giving away <a title="Free £5 To Spend on eBay" href="https://yayfryday.com/post/free-5-to-spend-on-ebay/" target="_blank">free fivers</a>, it was only £1 inc p&amp;p from Hong Kong. I think it's so cute!

Have you ever tried nail art pens? Any tips?

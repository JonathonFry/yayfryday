Yesterday I did end up making cheescakes using the new Philadelphia with Cadbury, and they are so yum!!  They are so quick and easy to make, and the philadelphia alone is really nice which I found surprising as I wasn't sure what it would be like. You could just spread it on a digestive and you've pretty much got a tasty cheesecake already. But I decided to go ahead and make the cheesecakes featured on the Philadelphia website <a href="http://www.philadelphia.co.uk/philadelphia3/page?locale=uken1&amp;PagecRef=609&amp;rid=40107&amp;fb_source=message" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: center;">75 g light digestive biscuits (I used 4.5 biscuits)</span>
<span style="text-align: center;">20 g butter, melted</span>
<span style="text-align: center;">160 g Philadelphia with Cadbury</span>
<span style="text-align: center;">180 g double cream</span>
<span style="text-align: center;">20 g icing sugar</span></p>
Firstly to make the base just bash up the biscuits in to crumbs and mix with the melted butter. Place the mix in to 5 ring moulds (6-7cm) or ramekins or maybe just make one big cheesecake, and place in the fridge. Then in a bowl whisk together the Philadelphia with Cadbury (the tub is 160g so use it all), double cream and icing sugar. Once it's all mixed together and looking good (have a taste ;)), place it on to the cheesecake bases and spread it all over the top, then return them to the fridge for a couple of hours to set. You could add whatever you'd like to the philly mixture, like fudge pieces or chocolate chips, to make it even better!

They make just the right sized cheesecakes, perfect. The Philadelphia is currently on offer at Asda for £1 for a 160g tub. Let me know if you make any, or have tried the Cadbury Philadelphia!

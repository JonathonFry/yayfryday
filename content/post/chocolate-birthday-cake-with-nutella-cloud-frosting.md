On Sunday I baked myself a birthday cake. I was really in the mood to bake something and it was my birthday the next day so I thought why not! It's oh so chocolatey and delicious, just the way I like :)

I did cheat and buy a box mix (Betty Crocker'sÂ <a href="http://www.bettycrocker.co.uk/Our-Products/Cake-Mixes/Devils-Food-Cake" target="_blank">Devil's Food Cake</a>) because I wanted to give it a go and be a bit lazy. But I did make the frosting from scratch and it's amazing! I followed the recipe for nutella cloud frosting from <a href="http://sweetapolita.com/2012/03/chocolate-birthday-cupcakes-with-nutella-cloud-frosting/" target="_blank">Sweetapolita</a>, and it really does have an airy cloud-like texture.

Now let's see how long this cake will last...

Yay it arrived! This afternoon the postie came and delivered my new Tala icing bag set, and I love the look of it. The tin is really cute and handy to keep all the bits together. I don't want to lose any like I did with my old set and there's also enough room (if you take out the packaging) to store more bits and pieces. It looks really good quality, just excited to try it out now. So plans for this weekend shall include baking cupcakes, my boyfriend will be happy!

I bought it from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002U5C4ZC/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=103612307&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B000EUKOMA&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=17E9952TCET6ZSFR68AP" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and cost me Â£9.98, which is quite expensive but for the quality and look (and birthday cash) I think it's worth it.

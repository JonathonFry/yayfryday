Last weekend Jon & I went up north to Loch Tay with 2 of our friends and their black labrador pup. This was our second time staying in Loch Tay (we stayed in a beautiful cottage there for our anniversary last year), it's a lovely location with lots to do in the area.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom cottage ([this one](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3825964)) which had views over the lake, it's own private beach and a games room with a table tennis table. We played board games, sat by the fire, cooked in the fantastic kitchen and went walking by the lake and up in to the mountains. There was no TV and I had no phone signal, so it was a complete retreat away from screens and it felt so good.

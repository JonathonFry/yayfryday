A couple of days ago I had a bit of time spare so painted my nails. I used Max Factor's nailfinity in Red Passion that I had for my bday. It's a lovely vibrant red. I used the nail art pen again that I used <a title="Chevron Nail Art" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chevron-nail-art/">here</a>, and painted on some dots. The pen's great for doing polka dots, just make sure to put a clear coat of varnish on top or they might chip off. I think they look kinda ladybuggy/watermelony, nice and summery :)

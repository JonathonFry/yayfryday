<p style="text-align: left;">Vue cinemas are giving away free tickets to watch live coverage of the Olympics. You can book up to 6 tickets in one go and are first-come first-served across all of the Vue cinemas. You don't have to stay in the cinema the whole time or arrive at the start, as you can re-enter as many times as you like. So if there's just one event you wanted to see then it's ideal.Â I think it'd be pretty good to watch Usain Bolt on the big screen hopefully smashing another record!</p>

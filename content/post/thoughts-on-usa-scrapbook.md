I enjoyed making this scrapbook a lot. It's such a big book that I wasn't sure I could finish it. But I'm glad I chose a big project to put together for my first scrapbook as I learnt lots along the way. I started from the beginning and went through page by page, I think the improvements can be seen as the book progresses.

I always had making a scrapbook of the trip in my mind, so I made sure to keep hold of all those little bits and pieces whilst travelling to include in the book. This included the usual things like leaflets, receipts, menus, tickets, napkins, wristbands, tags, as well as random stuff like a drink stirrer and paper hat. Cool to look back on and great fillers too!

The pages above are my favourites. I think it's because of the colours and how the pages are filled without looking cluttered. I also like the circle cut of the middle page to keep the pages flowing together. Or maybe it's just because they feature doughnuts and ice-cream...

There are quite a few pockets in the book which I struggled with at the start. Towards the end I found what worked best for me, and this was cutting down half a page and using the scrap to make a pocket to stick back on to the half page. It seems to be the sturdiest and it's a lot easier to turn the page. For the pocket above I painted it black and cut out a window which I then covered in acetate.

My next scrapbook I'm thinking of making is a minibook, perhaps 4x6 - a lot smaller and manageable that way!

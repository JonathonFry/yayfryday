OK so my birthday was almost a month ago now so this is kinda late (dissertations suck), but I wanted to write a quick post about it like I did <a href="https://yayfryday.com/post/birthday-fun/" target="_blank">last year</a>. I'd just like to say thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes, cards, gifts and celebrations. I had a fantastic one :)

Again, as I share my birthday with 2 friends (they're twins!), we all went out in Edinburgh to celebrate. I bought a new dress with my birthday cash from ASOS, this one to be precise:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://yayfryday.com/images/2013/03/bdaydress.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1524" alt="bdaydress" src="https://yayfryday.com/images/2013/03/bdaydress.jpg" width="490" height="625" /></a>

which I loved :) Of course, I painted my nails too in my new <a title="Nails in Coralicious" href="https://yayfryday.com/post/nails-in-coralicious/">Coralicious polish</a>, love the bright colour against the black and white print.

During the day Jon took me for <a title="Lunch at Papii" href="https://yayfryday.com/post/lunch-at-papii/" target="_blank">lunch at Papii</a>, I popped in to uni for a couple of classes then returned home for a chinese takeaway. I also received lots of cool gifts, here's a couple I just had to share (excuse the lack of lighting!)...

<strong>1. The Travel Book: A Journey Through Every Country in the World.</strong> Where to go next... I'd love to travel around South America, especially Peru!

<strong>2. Krakow (Lonely Planet Encounter Guides) &amp; Polish Zloty.</strong> Jon and I are visiting Poland for a week with 6 friends in May!

<strong>3. Gok Cooks Chinese.</strong> Jon and I cooked the Soy Glazed Chicken for Valentine's Day and it was divine.

And that's my 23rd birthday!

We've been getting a lot of blue skies lately and it's getting me in a bright summery mood. So to accompany the sunshine I've painted my nails in a bright new nail varnish that I bought for my birthday. It's Rimmel 60 Second nail polish in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rimmel-Nail-Polish-Second-Coralicious/dp/B0046U82I2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top" target="_blank">Coralicious</a>.

I love this colour! It's so bright and fresh, and makes me smile each time the colour catches my eye. I don't think I've ever tried Rimmel nail varnish before, and I must say I'm impressed. The brush is so wide which makes application super easy and quick. And it dries within the 60 seconds as advertised. It's fine with just one coat, but if you want it extra bright I'd go for 2.

I can see this bottle will be getting lots of use over summer!

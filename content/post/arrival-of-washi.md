My washi tape and labels from <a href="http://freckledfawn.com/" target="_blank">Freckled Fawn</a> arrived this very morning, and so far I likey! I finally own washi tape, and now I must use it... Yep I already feel the need to get more. Especially since they keep updating their stock with new products!

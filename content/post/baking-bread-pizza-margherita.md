Bread 12/15: [Pizza margherita](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4683/pizza-margherita-in-4-easy-steps)

Notes: I replaced the 300g bread flour stated in the recipe with 225g '00' flour and 75g finely ground semolina flour (thanks for the tip [Jamie](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/recipe/pizza-dough)!). I also left the dough to rise for an hour after kneading it.

Review: It's been a couple years since I've made pizza from scratch, and although it's not a typical 'bread' I think the base counts! The pizza turned out really good, flavours were great and the only thing I think that would improve it is if I had a pizza stone and stretched the dough a little thinner.

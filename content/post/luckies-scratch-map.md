I bought this Luckies scratch map (from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003NCIPS6/)) a couple of weeks ago and I love it. I've only scratched off the countries that Jon and I have been to together. (I didn't scratch Alaska/Hawaii as part of the USA though and decided to treat those seperately.) We need to go to more countries so I can scratch them off as it's looking pretty unscratched!

I framed it in an [IKEA Ribba frame](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/00128409/) (the one that has a 15 photo mount) which was almost perfect size - I just had to trim down some of the width to fit.  Now I need to get it up on the wall and make some plans!

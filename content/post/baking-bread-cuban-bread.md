Bread 7/15: Cuban Bread from <a href="http://pepperandsherry.com/2012/02/04/cuban-bread/" target="_blank">Pepper &amp; Sherry</a><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/eight-strand_plaited_57815" target="_blank">

Notes: So I didn't manage to bake 15 loaves by 2013 but I'm going to continue on anyway! I halved the recipe to make one loaf and added poppy seeds on top, everything else I kept to the recipe.

Review: One of my favourites so far. It only needs 15mins to rise in a warm place, and then goes straight in the oven (not preheated) with a tray of water underneath, simple. Oh and it tastes delicious too!

Thanks for the comment that shared this lovely recipe, and if you have any more recommendations of breads please leave a comment :)

Notes: I was a bit scared of making bagels, with the boiling stage and shaping them I thought something would probably go wrong along the way. I kept to the recipe since it had so many good reviews, and the only part I had trouble with was getting the round shape right. But they're almost there!

Review: so chewy, <em>so good</em>. I can see sweet cinnamon and raisin bagels being made with this recipe.

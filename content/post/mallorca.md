We spent 5 days exploring the beautiful and diverse island of Mallorca. I'm not sure why we had never though of visiting Mallorca before, but I am so glad we did. We stayed with my family at the dreamy [Finca Can Grenat](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/4542621?sug=51), and hired a car with [Hiper Rent a Car](https://www.hiperrentacar.com/en/).

Here are my highlights of our trip (besides relaxing by the pool and barbecues at the villa) in chronological order, with a bunch of photos too:

**Port de Pollença** - A lovely drive along the coast from Alcudia beach alongside cyclists, windsurfers and kitesurfers.

**Mirador Es Colomer** - Spectacular views of the coast and the Tramuntana mountains, with dramatic cliffs and the ocean that stretches out as far as the eye can see. There is a car park which can get very busy but quick turnaround of cars means you shouldn't need to wait long for a space. There is a small cafe too.

**Playa de Formentor** - A gorgeous narrow beach with mountain views and a backdrop of pine trees. Clear waters and a great spot for a dip in the sea to break up the drive on the way to Cap Formentor. We visited in the evening and it was pretty quiet. There are sun loungers you can hire or free gaps to set yourself up on the beach.

**Cap Formentor** - Watching the sunset here at the northernmost tip of Mallorca is incredible. There is parking at the lighthouse but people ended up just parking in the road as it filled up. The drive is quite thrilling too and part of the experience - watch out for goats!

**Cuevas del Drach** - There are lots of caves in Mallorca and we visited the well known "Dragon Caves" on the East of the island. The caves are extensive and the walk ends at a large underground lake with a small classical concert. Just be sure to hold back when entering to avoid the crowds (it gets super busy).

**S'Amarador** - This gorgeous unspoilt white sand beach is tucked away in the wild Mondrago Natural Park. There are lots of walks you can take from here and there is a beach shack selling food and amazing fresh cocktails (the mojito was excellent). There is paid parking and you should avoid using google maps to get here (you reach a road sign that says 'GPS IS WRONG' and need to turn back) - instead follow the clear brown signs for S'Amarador.

**Cala d'Or** - This resort is near to Mondrago park and we stopped at the marina here for dinner. There are plenty of restaurants and bars to chose from, and a nice place to wander around the big yachts. We ate at Aquarius looking out on to the marina. The food was good and prices decent, but the service wasn't the best.

**Valldemossa** - A wonderfully picturesque village in the mountains. We wandered amongst the cobbled streets filled with plants and bunting, taking lots of photographs as every street was so photo-worthy. This was a definite highlight of the trip for me. Lots of great places for lunch and ice-cream here too.

**Deià** - This village is just a 10 minute drive away from Valldemossa. There are fantastic mountain backdrops as you look across to the village, with more cobbled streets and pretty bunting in the centre.

**Palma** - Our last stop visit was in to the capital city. We didn't spend long here but had a nice wander around the impressive cathedral and ended the day with delicious ice-creams.

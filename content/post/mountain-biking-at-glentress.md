A few weeks back Jon and I went mountain biking at [7Stanes Glentress](http://7stanesmountainbiking.com/Glentress---Innerleithen). We went to celebrate his 24th birthday (hooray!) and it was so much fun. I was pretty nervous about going since I hadn't been cycling for a couple years (not since I'd fallen off in Greece) and never been mountain biking before.

Glentress has won many awards and is one of the best biking centres in the UK. It is made up of various colour coded trails for different abilities. It's only less than an hours drive away from Edinburgh and we hired bikes from the centre when we arrived. We stuck with the green (easy) routes which were a lot of fun, and tried part of a blue route but it terrified me!

We both really enjoyed it and although I couldn't walk the next day I would definitely go back!

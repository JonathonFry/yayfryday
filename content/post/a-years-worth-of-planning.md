Today we started to pack(when I say we I mean Sarah), and it's nice to see so much planning finally coming together.

Absolutely tipping down at the moment in Wales so can't wait to finally get on with the trip and to some lovely American weather.

Have been trying to cram as many famous American movies before we go so we can snap some great photos.

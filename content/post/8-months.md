Jon and I have been in this flat in Edinburgh for just over 8 months now. And we love it! The high ceilings and big windows are my favourite and there's so much space (we even have some empty cupboards/drawers still!).

I realised looking through these photos that I must have a thing for plants or I just like to take photos of them. The olive tree in our kitchen is my favourite of all. It's from IKEA and it's growing pretty fast with all the sunshine we've had lately.

Here are a few photos I've taken recently from around our home.

Carrying on with the almond and fruit based baking (after making this delicious [pear and frangipane tart](https://yayfryday.com/pear-and-frangipane-tart/)), I found a recipe for orange and almond cake. A pretty simple cake and with a boost of vitamin c from the oranges it's almost healthy.

I used the BBC Food's [orange and almond cake recipe](https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/orangecake_83870). The recipe starts with boiling some oranges in a pan, which left the kitchen smelling divine, and then blitzing them up whole.

The end result was a super tasty and zingy cake. I think it lasted just two days between the two of us.

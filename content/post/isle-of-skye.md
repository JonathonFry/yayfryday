I've wanted to go to Skye ever since moving to Scotland almost eight years ago. Jon & I agreed that we wouldn't leave Scotland before we visited, and so we finally made it there this year. We drove up on Jon's birthday (May 24th), which we hoped would be the best time of year in terms of weather and midges. Turned out we were extremely lucky with both - sunshine, 20 something degrees and zero midge bites. Definitely not typical of a Scottish holiday.

We spent three glorious days exploring Skye. Here are my highlights of the trip.

Reflections of Eilean Donan Castle on the way to Skye. Walks with stunning and diverse scenery including the Fairy Pools, Coral Beach, Old Man of Storr, and the Quiraing. Checking off a munro by hiking up Bruach na Frithe. The moment the clouds finally cleared for the final stretch and I had that on top of the world feeling.

Magic hour at Neist Point. Mac and cheese at the Black Sheep food truck at Kilt Rock. Camping besides beaches and barbecuing a whole block of halloumi. Seeing an eagle and two deer up close. Having a nap in the car during a rain shower then waking up and seeing the Isle of Skye Brewery opposite. Dinner at Edinbane Inn. The ferry back from Armadale to Mallaig and an epic drive home.

I can't believe it took us eight years to make it to Skye. It's topped my list of places to visit in Scotland.

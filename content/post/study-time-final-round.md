Revision is now in full flow. I've submitted my dissertation (WOO!) and my last ever MATLAB coursework (YAY!), and now it's just 3 exams to go and it'll all be finished. Jon and I are celebrating completing our dissertations by going for a meal tomorrow to Jamie's Italian (we have a free <a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/italian/signup" target="_blank">£10 voucher</a> to spend that comes with the card ;) ).

Scary but exciting that it's almost over!

Yesterday I did some more baking, but this time I had to pop to the shop to pick up 2 lemons. I baked a lovely lemon drizzle cake. It's my first attempt at this cake and I was happy with the result - although I think there was a bit too much mix in my loaf tin as it went HUGE, so next time I'll either scale down the ingredients or do the loaf as well as some little cupcakes.

Here's how it was made..

Here is the recipe I followed via <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4942/lemon-drizzle-cake">BBC Good Food</a> <em>(my changes in bold)</em>:
<blockquote>Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Beat together 225g softened unsalted butter and 225g caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add 4 eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through. Sift in 225g flour, then add the finely grated zest of <strong>1.5 lemons</strong> and mix until well combined. Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.

Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the juice of <strong>2 lemons</strong> and 85g caster sugar to make the drizzle. Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle - the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping. Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.</blockquote>
The cake was lovely and moist, but the top was definitely the best part ;)

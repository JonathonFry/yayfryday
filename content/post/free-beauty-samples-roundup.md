As shown in the photo above I do go a bit crazy for free stuff from time to time. If I see a good sample I want to try then I will end up searching for more and get as many as I can in one big go. So recently I've been going sample hunting and trying to find some good ones. Here are my latest goodies:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2969.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-771" title="latest samples" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2969.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="344" /></a><em>Diesel Only The Brave Tattoo//L'Oreal Men Expert Hydra Energetic//Herbal Essences Hello Hydration//Garnier BB Cream//L'Oreal Youth Code Luminize</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far I've only tried the <a href="https://secure.garnier.co.uk/_en/_gb/BB-cream/" target="_blank">Garnier BB Cream</a> and I think it's awesome. It's good having so much in one cream, incl SPF 15 so I was sorted with that for the sunny days. Jon is using the <a href="http://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/skincare/hydra-energetic/daily-moisturising-lotion.aspx" target="_blank">L'Oreal Hydra Energetic Moisturiser </a>and really likes it, and it smells good too.</p>
Here are some samples I've collected together that are currently available to grab:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://apps.facebook.com/hairexpertise/" target="_blank">Loreal EverPure Hair Expertise Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Sample</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.boots-samples.com/une/skin-glow/" target="_blank">UNE Beauty Skin-Glow Foundation Sample</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://secure.garnier.co.uk/_en/_gb/BB-cream/samples/form1PreBis.aspx" target="_blank">Garnier B.B. Cream Miracle Skin Perfector Samples</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/_en/_gb/caps/index.aspx?id=Cap_120213_Youth_Code_Luminize" target="_blank">Loreal Youth Code Luminize Super Serum Samples</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://apps.facebook.com/elviveuk/" target="_blank">Loreal Elvive Triple Resist Sample</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://apps.facebook.com/lumimagique/" target="_blank">Loreal Lumi Magique Foundation Sample</a></li>
</ul>
and here's one for the guys:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://fragrancesrestage.hugoboss.com/uk/boss-bottled-sport-ingredients" target="_blank">BOSS Bottled/Sports/Night Samples</a></li>
</ul>
I'm sure there are many more out there, these are just ones I've recently received/requested. Always handy to have if you ever run out of anything or for travelling, etc.

Also if you buy Glamour's July magazine (RRP £2) that's released tomorrow they come with free Benefit make-up minis! Choose from The Porefessional pore minimiser (£10), That Gal face primer (£15) and Bad Gal mascara (£10). Great saving and good for travel.

<strong>When / Where / Weather:</strong> Saturday / Union Canal / sun

<strong>Comments: </strong>Week 5 already, it's going by so quick. The sun was out today and there were quite a few people along the canal. We passed a lady taking close up photos of something on the ground, and later realised it was probably of newts as we noticed them along the path and made sure not to step on any! I felt quite tired after this run, but I can feel my cardio has improved from week 1 for sure.

<strong>When / Where / Weather:</strong> Monday / Union Canal / windy

<strong>Comments: </strong>The wind has been so bad these last couple days and it continued today. It made it difficult for our run out but helped with the run back. It was 2 runs of 8 mins each which felt good as after 1 run there was only one more to go! At the end of the run we both felt we had energy to keep going. I love how these runs are breaking up revision, always looking forward to the next one. I'm nervous for the next one though as there won't be any walking in between, Jon thinks it'll be fine though so we'll see.

<strong>When / Where / Weather:</strong> Wednesday / Union Canal / rain

<strong>Comments: </strong>We did it!! It rained heavily all the way through the run. I had my rainproof coat on with hood up which kept most of the rain off me. Jon's coat isn't waterproof so he had it worse, but regardless of the rain we did the full 20 mins! It actually felt really good. I was worried I would struggle but once we started and got into a rhythm, I felt like I could keep on going. Jon didn't take his phone with the nike+ app on because of the rain (both of our pockets were soaked through after) so we don't know how we did for pace etc, but we'll see how next week goes!

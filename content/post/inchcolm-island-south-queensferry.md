As mentioned previously, my Dad came up to Edinburgh to visit and on the Sunday we went across to [Inchcolm Island](http://www.maidoftheforth.co.uk/inchcolm-island). The boat to Inchcolm leaves from South Queensferry, right under the Forth Bridge. This was my first time here and we will be back to explore more of this area (I have heard it's a great spot for sunsets too).

We had around 2 hours to spend on Inchcolm. We had a picnic, wandered around the abbey and ran away from the dive-bombing seagulls. Jon was lucky enough to spot a puffin fly past, and there were lots of seals sunbathing on the rocks. We wished we had longer to explore more of the island, although it was a very hot day so we were glad to get back for an ice-cream!

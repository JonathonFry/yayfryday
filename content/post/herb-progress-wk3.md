As you can see they're all still alive and growing :) I thinned the basil and parsley down quite a lot, I felt bad doing it but they were so overcrowded (the parsley's still a bit wild). The parsley was pretty difficult as it's become quite tangled but I managed to thin out about half of the seedlings. And now they are all starting to grow their second set of 'true leaves'.

I'm off down to Cardiff tomorrow morning for the next two weeks, yay! I hope the herbs don't all die by the time I get back though...

On Friday I had my last ever exam at University. 4 years of studying are over and it's on to the big wide world now! Since I've finished I've been tidying and clearing out the flat, it gets so messy during revision times and I'm so happy to get rid of all of my notes that filled 8 lever arched files. I can now do fun things again - woohoo!!

Hope you are having a great bank holiday weekend :)

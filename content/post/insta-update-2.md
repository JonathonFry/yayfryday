London. Two weekends ago I took a trip to London to visit a Uni friend. It was *so much* fun. We went out Saturday night and slept until 12 on Sunday. We did some sightseeing, had lunch at an Indian cafe in Covent Garden, ate cookies, and (window) shopped.

This weekend. Jon and I cooked our 7th recipe from [Jamie's 30-Minute Meals](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jamies-30-Minute-Meals-Revolutionary-Approach/dp/0718154770/). Fantastic as always. We had Jools' Pasta. We watched part 1 of the BBC's [Yellowstone](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1415175/) on Saturday. It's incredible. We are now planning a trip to the US next year and Yellowstone is top of the list!

Shopping. We popped to Bruntsfield over the weekend for some shopping. Despite living a 10min walk away we've never been in to the lovely shops (only the coffee ones!). I bought this bag from [Very Vintage](http://www.very-vintage-edinburgh.co.uk/home/4581709125) (it only opened up on Wednesday). That's the second Scaramanga bought in two months... oops.

Hope you're having a lovely weekend.

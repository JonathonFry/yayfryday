Bread 4/15: Dorie Greenspan's <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/recipes/2010/10/21/savory-cheese-and-chive-bread/" target="_blank">Savory Cheese and Chive Bread</a>

Notes: This is a quick bread and not a yeast one. I added 1/2 tsp of paprika and used mature cheddar, and finally got some use out of my chives! I also sprinkled some of the cheddar on top of the dough before baking.

Review: Loved how quick it was to make with no waiting around to rise. The smell coming from the oven was so good it was hard to wait for the bread to cool, and it sure does taste as good as it smells. Great flavour and texture.

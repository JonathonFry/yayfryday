As <a title="Free Beauty Samples Roundup" href="https://yayfryday.com/post/free-beauty-samples-roundup/">previously posted</a>, Glamour magazine are currently giving away Benefit products with their magazines. So today after work I was walking back through town and decided to stop off at Boots on Princes St and found loads of them on the shelves. I managed to pick up 2 different ones and then stopped at a corner shop to get the third to complete the collection.

<a href="https://yayfryday.com/images/2012/06/glamour-benefit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-794" title="glamour benefit" src="https://yayfryday.com/images/2012/06/glamour-benefit.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="651" /></a>

The magazine itself costs £2 and the free Benefit gifts are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.benefitcosmetics.co.uk/product/view/that-gal" target="_blank">"that gal"</a> brightening face primer (7.5ml worth £15)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.benefitcosmetics.co.uk/product/view/the-porefessional" target="_blank">the POREfessional</a> PRO balm to minimise the appearance of pores (7.5ml worth £10)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.benefitcosmetics.co.uk/product/view/badgal-lash-mascara" target="_blank">BADgal lash</a> mascara (4g worth £10)</li>
</ul>
I'm looking forward to trying them out as I've only tried the mascara which I really like, and have heard great things about the others. Hopefully they'll last as long as Glamour's previous Benefit freebies that I've bought! I still have a bit of my full-sized It Stick concealer (now discontinued), eye bright pencil and BADgal eyeliner (unopened yet as I'm still using one I bought).

As for the extra magazines I now have, don't worry they won't be thrown in the bin. I have lots of ideas to use them for incl this <a title="Time For a Catch Up" href="https://yayfryday.com/post/catch-up-time/">mirror frame</a> ;)

Glamour give away Benefit products each year, and I think for £2 it's a bargain. Have you tried these products? What do you think of them?

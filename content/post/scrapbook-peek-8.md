Since yesterday I've completed 4 more pages in my scrapbook. I think I only have like 2 more pages to do before I go back and tidy up some of the earlier pages, add a few simple pages to the beginning and ends (I'm going to print out the blog posts we wrote whilst on the road and stick them in at the end), then finally get round to journalling.

Here's the pages I finished today, it looks pretty cluttered but I think looking at the pages as a whole it's not so crazy. Although these couple of days in LA were rather hectic!

I'm still enjoying making it, and I'm now craving a Pink's chili dog!!

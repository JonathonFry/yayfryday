During our [five day trip to Barcelona](http://yayfryday.com/5-days-in-barcelona/) we stayed four nights in two wonderful hotels. Since it was a special trip for us (our first wedding anniversary), we wanted to stay somewhere memorable.

Staying in two hotels was partly due to the fact that there wasn't availability in one of the hotels the whole time we were in Barcelona, so we thought we'd make the most of it and discover two areas of the city. We've also done this before to see the 'tourist' areas but also see the more local side of a city.

Three nights were spent in the delicious **[Hotel Praktik Bakery](http://www.hotelpraktikbakery.com/)**. The hotel is a bakery hotel (a hotel and bakery combined), that had me hooked as soon as I stumbled on it on TripAdvisor. It was an obvious choice to stay here, a unique concept and the bedrooms were beautiful and simple. The location (L'Eixample) was ideal for us to visit the Gaudi sights as well as all the other spots in the centre of the city.

I loved waking up to the smell of freshly baked bread, the sunshine pouring through the window and eating freshly made croissants in bed.

**[Hotel Brummell](http://www.hotelbrummell.com/)** was our final destination for the last night of our trip, and we thought we'd end it on a high and stay on the top floor. I was attracted to this hotel because it was highly rated, has cool interior design and looked like a nice local area (El Poble-sec). There are lots of walks and parks in the area, as well as tasty restaurants and bars. It's right near the port cable car and the Montjuïc castle is up the hill.

I loved sitting on the terrace overlooking the city, having a bath outdoors during siesta and travelling the quickest way from the beach to the hotel via cable car.

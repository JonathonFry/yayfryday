I've <del>started to spend</del> spent all of the £100 that I won from Uni which I mentioned <a title="Taste of Edinburgh Cancelled…" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/taste-of-edinburgh-cancelled/">here</a>. Something that I wanted to buy was a new nail varnish and I decided on <a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;catalogId=33057&amp;storeId=12556&amp;productId=2412181&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=&amp;searchTerm=Pool&amp;pageSize=20" target="_blank">this one</a> from Topshop in Pool Party. It's a lovely, bright and glossy turquoisey blue - great for summer! I only own pinks, reds and neutral nail polishes so it was good to get something totally different.

I only put it on today so I can't comment on how long it'll last, although at work my nails chip <em>a lot </em>so I'm not expecting too much, but it was nice and thick and feels good quality. In the photo I only have one coat on and no top coat so it's not completely opaque. It's my first Topshop nail varnish and I already want more, they have so many good colours! It cost £5 but as a student with 10% off it came down to £4.50 ;)

Along with my new nail polish I bought lots of clothes. I rarely buy clothes, usually just after Christmas and my birthday, but when I do I tend to buy them all in one go.  I'm definitely more of a saver than a spender. I may post about what I bought tomorrow :D

This weekend was Jon's birthday weekend (hooray!) and we spent our Saturday in East Lothian. 

We started the day at Seacliff beach (they normally have a barrier charging Â£2 per car for parking but it was broken). The drive from Edinburgh was lovely, passing through fields of rapeseed, and the sandy beach at Seacliff was nice and quiet. There are great views of Bass Rock and Tantallon castle here, somehow this was our first visit (and will not be our last). We went for a walk along the rocks, past the teeny harbour, towards the castle.

Late afternoon we drove to North Berwick. I had pre-bought tickets for the [Three Islands Seabird Seafari](https://www.seabird.org/boats/three-islands-seabird-seafari/14/159) RIB trip and the weather was perfect for it.

The highlight for me was the puffins on Craigleith Island. The volume of gannets on Bass Rock was amazing too, and it was a good idea to put the hood from the waterproofs up as there were a lot of birds flying above us! It was so much fun, we want to do the Isle of May trip next.

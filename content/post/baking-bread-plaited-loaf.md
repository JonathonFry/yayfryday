Bread 6/15: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/eight-strand_plaited_57815" target="_blank">Plaited Loaf</a>

Notes: OK, so I was supposed to do the eight-strand loaf as in the recipe, but I tried and failed... my kitchen is too small I couldn't spread the 8 strands out wide enough and I just went for a simple 3 strand loaf in the end. One day I will do it, but for now this is good enough for me :p

Review: Yummy and soft. Think it could do with a bit more salt, I've just run out so there's only a teeny bit in it. We ate around half the loaf with leftover sausage casserole for lunch, and tomorrow we'll have some with soup! So good with this cold weather.

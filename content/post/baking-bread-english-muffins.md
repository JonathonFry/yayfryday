Bread 14/15: [English Muffins](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/english_muffins_56640)

Notes: Stuck to the recipe. The dough was really wet which made it quite hard to knead. They were 'baked' in a frying pan on the hob.

Review: I eat english muffins quite a lot for breakfast (straight from the freezer to the toaster) so I thought they'd be a good choice, plus they're a bit different since they aren't baked in the oven. They taste good and Jon and I ate them for our weekday breakfasts with nutella or toasted with butter. The texture was slightly different to the shop bought muffins, they were more airy which I think was because of the wet dough.

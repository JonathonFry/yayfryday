I've had a tin of pumpkin puree in my cupboard for quite some time, knowing that at some point I would bake something with it. Then a copy of olive magazine came through my door. I spotted the pumpkin pie spiced muffins recipe and knew instantly that was what I would bake.

They are so tasty and the sponge is lovely and moist. The spice isn't too overpowering either (which I was worried about), it's nice and subtle. I only iced 6 of the muffins and I like the non iced ones just as much.

I still have half a tin of the pumpkin puree left, so I'm keeping my eye out for another recipe. Or perhaps I'll just have to make these again ;)

On Saturday we popped across to Cramond beach for another camera outing. (Above photo via [Instagram](http://instagram.com/sarahszwandt).)

This time I played with the advanced options in Guide mode. I can see this being a really useful feature to help learn how some of the manual modes work. I also tried out different release modes and zoom.

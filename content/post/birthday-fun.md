Saturday was my birthday! Which is why I have taken so long to write a post on here as I've been so busy, but now I have a bit of time I thought I'd write a post about it. Firstly I'd like to thank my boyfriend, family and friends for the lovely cards and gifts and for those that could make it out on the night!

So a couple of weeks back my boyfriend asked me for some birthday ideas, and I found some jewellery that had been blogged about <a href="http://sweetmondayblog.blogspot.com/">here</a> that I really wanted. Then when my birthday came and I opened my presents I was surprised to receive these two from him that I love :D

Firstly is a necklace from <a href="http://www.wallpaperrose.bigcartel.com/">Wallpaper Rose</a> which is so cool as it  has a clock inside, and was prettily packaged with a bow. Wallpaper Rose is worth a look, I want more haha!

<p style="text-align: left;">Secondly was this cute little friendship bracelet from <a href="http://lilyloveslola.bigcartel.com/">Lily Loves Lola</a>. I'd recommend this shop, there are lots of different bracelets all at a good price of just £2.50 each.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The Saturday wasn't just my birthday, it was also 2 of my friends birthdays too. So we all went out to Hive (classy.. :/) but it's so cheap there and we always have a good time! So of course I had to do my nails :) I decided to paint them with Avon mirror shine in bronze, which I've owned for years but hardly worn, and Barry M black crackle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://yayfryday.com/images/2012/02/IMGP2351.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-140" title="IMGP2351" src="https://yayfryday.com/images/2012/02/IMGP2351-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><a href="https://yayfryday.com/images/2012/02/IMGP2353.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-141" title="IMGP2353" src="https://yayfryday.com/images/2012/02/IMGP2353-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I like the way they turned out and matched my dress. My dress was from <a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;viewAllFlag&amp;catalogId=33057&amp;storeId=12556&amp;productId=4212208&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId&amp;searchTerm=SEQUIN|&amp;pageSize=20&amp;fb_source=message#13276692761531&amp;country:undefined^language:undefined^currencySymbol:undefined^preferredUrl:undefined^siteLabel:undefined^langId:undefined^storeId:undefined^salesCatalogId:undefined^viewed:undefined^explicit:undefined" target="_blank">Topshop</a> and was only £15 in the sale, and although the sequins rubbed my arm a bit, I really liked it!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So that's my birthday done for a year and next up is Valentine's day, time is flying by! We managed to grab some Titanic 3D tickets for tomorrow and I am so glad I kept checking for them, be persistent and hope for cancellations if you want to see it. Hope you all have a lovely day filled with love and chocolate :)</p>

After a great week of weather the weekend comes along and brings with it the rain. At least we had to spend most of the day waiting in on an IKEA delivery and then 3 hours building a sofabed. At around 8pm we decided it was time to leave the flat despite the downpour. It doesn't seem like summer with this weather but I am so enjoying these long daylight hours.

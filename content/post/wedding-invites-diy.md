Hooray - our wedding invites should have arrived with everyone by now. I wanted them to be quite simple, and I am pleased with how they came out.

We started by looking online, places like Etsy, and struggled to find anything we loved. Whilst browsing I stumbled on a link to Creative Market and a downloadable photoshop template which looked just what we were looking for ([here](https://creativemarket.com/HitchPaperCo/139680-Wedding-Invitation-Template-Suite)). We had them printed with [Vistaprint](http://www.vistaprint.co.uk/) on 5x7 premium matte card stock, and went with the free envelopes.

The info and RSVP cards are just 5x7 cards cut in half. All the cards have a grey back, and the invite has an ampersand in Abril Fatface font (which I bookmarked a while back as it looks like a J and S). I made a band with kraft paper to hold together the 3 cards and jazzed up the envelopes a bit with washi tape (purchased [here](http://www.thefoxandstar.co.uk/)).

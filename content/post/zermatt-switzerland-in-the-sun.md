The alarm went off on Sunday and we jumped to the end of the bed to open the blinds. It was still pretty dark outside but as our eyes adjusted we could make out a white triangle - the Matterhorn!

We packed our bags and headed for the train station lockers. It was amazing to see the mountains that were surrounding the town, it felt so different to the day before. Since the weather was so nice we decided we would take the Gornergrat train up to the top of the mountain. It was so worth it.

It was -17C at the top but the sun definitely helped. We hiked down from **Rotenboden > Riffelberg**. This was an interesting hike as it turned out we were on a snowshoe trail (the walking trail was hidden under the snow). We came across another walker who was as confused about the trail as we were and it seemed we were way off track. We were trying to find the Riffelsee lake (which we later discovered was just buried under the snow). It was a fantastic walk regardless (although I did step thigh deep in snow twice, Jon had to help me out!).

At Riffelberg we sat in the sun with a drink and a toblerone (we couldn't help ourselves!), before taking the train back down to Zermatt and catching the train on to Visp and onwards to Basel. (We stocked up on chocolate & fondue before we left too)

I only wish we had more time there, though my bank balance wouldn't be too happy about it!

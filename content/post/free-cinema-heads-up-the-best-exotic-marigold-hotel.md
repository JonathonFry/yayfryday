<p style="text-align:left;">Those with RBS current accounts can get tickets to see '<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1412386/" target="_blank">The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</a>' from February 8th! Make sure you register online before they are released as they do go quickly. I think that Natwest are also offering tickets for this film too. Here's the link for the tickets courtesy of RBS: <a href="http://filmfirst.rbs.co.uk/preview/film/marigold-hotel/synopsis/" target="_blank">RBS Film First: The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</a>.</p>
Also, I have just requested a free sample of Loreal Hair Expertise shampoo &amp; conditioner! I say samples but they are full sized bottles - 250ml. Here's the link where they are giving them away: <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/hairexpertise/" target="_blank">Loreal Hair Expertise</a>. The first 4300 entrants will receive it, so don't hesitate!

Been busy with Uni work, I have 2 midterms next week so trying to study for them as well as applying for summer internships, so haven't been able to post as much as I'd like. Will keep updating though whenever I find good deals!

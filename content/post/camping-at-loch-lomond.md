Since the weather's been so great lately, Jon and I decided to make the most of it and go on a little camping trip in Scotland. Our friends recommended <a href="http://www.lochlomond-trossachs.org/visiting/sallochy-campsite/menu-id-335.html" target="_blank">Sallochy campsite</a> at Loch Lomond, they've stayed there 3 times in the last couple of weeks! It's around 1.5hrs drive from Edinburgh and you have to book a pitch online for £5 per person.

We went Friday night after Jon finished work and arrived by 8pm. It was the first time using our new Vango tent which we bought last weekend off gumtree for £20. Luckily we managed to get it up OK and get the barbecue on the go within an hour :) We stayed at one of the lochside pitches which was fantastic, just a few steps from the beach which was secluded into little coves.

We were out in our shorts until 11pm and it was still so bright. We got attacked by the midges and woke up to see the little pink midge bites all over us! It was pretty chilly in the night and morning. We wrapped up whilst eating our breakfast on the beach before packing up the tent (which took us way longer than pitching it...) and headed up the road to Rowardennan.

We went for a walk (which was supposed to be a long one but I only brought my sandals with me) along the lake. It was super quiet after just a 5 min walk from the car park. We found an empty beach and ate our lunch admiring the views and listening to the waves.

Along came a duck and 2 chicks. We threw them some of the crust from our sandwiches, and along came another duck with 7 teeny fluffy chicks.

We will definitely be coming back to Loch Lomond! Hope you've had a nice weekend enjoying the sunshine.

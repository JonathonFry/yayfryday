I’ve just ordered 8 free fabric samples from <a href="http://sofa.com/">sofa.com</a> that I think would be great use for crafting with. I love the Navajo stripes – the ‘eagle’ swatch would look great for my Monument Valley scrapbook page ;) Of course, if you’re looking for a sofa/bed it’s worth getting the swatches to have a look at what colour/material you’d like.

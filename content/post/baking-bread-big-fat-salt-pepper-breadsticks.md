Bread 8/15: Big Fat Salt &amp; Pepper Breadsticks from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358520787&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Lorraine Pascale’s Baking Made Easy</a><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/eight-strand_plaited_57815" target="_blank">
</a>

Notes: I made 12 breadsticks as stated in the recipe, each 25cm long. I shaped half of them into twists and used chilli salt, black pepper, poppy seeds and sea salt as toppings.

Review: They're great for dipping, but I found them quite chewy on their own. I also would have preferred them to be thinner, perhaps by dividing the dough into more sticks or making extra long ones. The chilli salt ones were my favourite.

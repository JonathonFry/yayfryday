A couple of days ago my adhesive runner ran out. I picked up another one from <a href="http://www.shoppapertiger.com/" target="_blank">Paper Tiger</a> which is only a 10min walk  away (great shop btw for supplies, cards and gifts) and have now been able to finish the main body of my scrapbook! All of my photos are in, so now I think it'll be another couple weeks or so until it'll <em>all</em> be complete.

Here's a peek at my last couple pages - Universal Studios and leaving the US.

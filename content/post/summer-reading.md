[The Fault in our Stars](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fault-Our-Stars-John-Green/dp/0141345659/) by John Green | I read this at the beginning of summer after hearing so much about it. It was a good quick read and it was sad. I wasn't so keen on the movie though.

[The Light Between Oceans](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Light-Between-Oceans-Stedman/dp/0552778478/) by M L Stedman | I had to try not to tear up whilst reading the second half on a long train journey. It wasn't something I would normally go for and although I felt parts of it went quite slow, I enjoyed it overall.

[Gone Girl](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gone-Girl-Gillian-Flynn/dp/0753827662/) by Gillian Flynn | I read this in Tunisia and it was a thrilling page turner. I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending though.

[The Shock of the Fall](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/000749145X/) by Nathan Filer | I got through this book really quickly. I really enjoyed it and found it thought provoking and quite dark, but also funny.

I'm currently reading [I Am Pilgrim by Terry Hayes](http://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Am-Pilgrim-Terry-Hayes/dp/0552160962/), and then next up is [The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Unlikely-Pilgrimage-Harold-Fry/dp/0552778095/). For a bit of non-fiction, Jon & I have both just started reading [The 4-Hour Work Week](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-4-Hour-Work-Week-Anywhere/dp/0091929113/).

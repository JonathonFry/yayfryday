This weekend has been great, such lovely weather so I wanted to make the most of being outside. So me and Jon spent our time on Saturday at Gullane beach and Sunday at the meadows with friends and barbecues.

I hope this weather lasts, the sun just seems to put everyone in a happy mood. I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You</a> and so far loving it, I don't want it to end!

The beach at Gullane is nice, and luckily our friends have a car so we could get down there easily. From Edinburgh there is a First bus that does go there and other beaches too - the no. 124 I think. Here's a cute pic of Natalie and Mike at the beach :)

Hope y'all are enjoying the weather too!

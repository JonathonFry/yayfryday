<p style="text-align: left;">Little late on posting this, but it's the weekend and I have a bit of spare time before I start revising for a midterm this Tuesday. I had a great Valentine's day, breakfast in bed and after Uni I came home to a lovely bouquet of red roses. I gave my boyfriend these truffles, there were 22 of them but by the time I took these pics there were only 3 remaining! So I can assume that he enjoyed them!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We went to see Titanic in 3D at the cinema, it was so good! The quality looks like a brand new film and the 3D was really good, not in your face and didn't make me feel ill like it sometimes does. I'd recommend going to see it when it comes out on April 6th, and don't forget the tissues! We had eaten dinner before going but didn't have time to have dessert so I quickly made some when we got in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We had bought some strawberries and cream, and we've still got a supply of chocolate from Christmas that we don't really like eating as a bar so I use it for baking with. I decided to make a chocolate ganache which I had made before from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jamies-30-Minute-Meals-Revolutionary-Approach/dp/0718154770" target="_blank">Jamie's 30-Minute Meals</a>. I just halved the ingredients and adapted it a bit.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Chocolate Ganache</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2380.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-187 alignnone" title="IMGP2380" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2380-300x283.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="283" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's so quick and simple to make. The ingredients I used were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>100g bar good quality chocolate (I used G&amp;B's Maya Gold which is infused with orange and spices)</li>
	<li>150ml single cream</li>
	<li>A pinch of salt</li>
	<li>Knob of butter</li>
	<li>Handful of strawberries for dipping</li>
</ul>
In Jamie's recipe he uses clementines in the ganache but using this chocolate it wasn't needed. I put all of the ingredients (minus the strawberries) into a heatproof bowl over boiling water to melt it all together.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2395.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-188 aligncenter" title="IMGP2395" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2395-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And it's done! Then just spoon it into whatever you have available and get dipping with whatever you fancy, so tasty!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So now I have 3 other bars remaining, any ideas on what I should do with them?!</p>

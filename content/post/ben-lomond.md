On Sunday Jon &amp; I, along with our friends Nat &amp; Mike, set off to Loch Lomond for some hill walking. We parked up at Rowardennan to tackle Ben Lomond. The 'Munro' is 974 m (3196 ft) high, making it the highest mountain we've walked up together. We were prepared for rain as always, but instead the sun was out the whole time and I ended up coming home with sunburnt arms...

We went up via the 'tourist route' and ended up going back down the same way (around 12km). We were so low on water and with the sun out we wanted to get back as soon as possible. Next time, for sure, we will take the CamelBak out with us. It was a pretty tough walk in parts during the ascent, but the way back down was so much better we were all pretty much running down it!

From the top we could see Ben Nevis in the distance. This was a fantastic walk and great practice for us.

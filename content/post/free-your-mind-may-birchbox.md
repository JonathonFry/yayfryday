The rain has been pouring on and off over the past week and with a weather warning it looks set to stay around for a little while longer. Thankfully the [May Birchbox](https://www.birchbox.co.uk/about/how-it-works) came through the post which brightened things up and was a lovely treat to come home to.

This is my first ever Birchbox and I love it. My photos are quite dark (...the rain), but here it is:

The box is designed to be coloured in, and comes with colouring pencils too so you can get going on it straight away. Here's what came in my box:

* NUDE ProGenius Omega Treatment Oil
* CAUDALIE Vinoperfect Radiance Tinted Moisturiser in *Light*
* LIZ EARLE BEAUTY CO Cleanse & Polish Hot Cloth Cleanser + Muslin Cloth
* PARLOR by Jeff Chastain Moisturising Sea Salt Spray
* JELLY PONG PONG Caribbean Sun Bronzer Duo in *Martinique*
* LOLA BARCELONA Nail Polish in *Rambla*
* NUMBER 4 Lumiere d'Hiver Reconstructing Masque
* Colouring Pencils

My favourites so far are the Liz Earle cleanser and Caudalie tinted moisturiser.

For Jon's birthday I bought him the [Birchbox Man Limited Edition Box](https://www.birchbox.co.uk/shop/birchbox-man-limited-edition-box). He loves it and it's a shame they don't do more boxes for men. He uses every one of the products in the box, and his favourite is the English Laundry Notting Hill cologne.

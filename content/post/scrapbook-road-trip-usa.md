{Photo heavy post} It's finally finished!!

It's been over a year since Jon and I <a href="https://yayfryday.com/post/road-trip-usa/" target="_blank">went to the US</a>, and now the scrapbook is done! Here is the complete final book (minus all of the printed out blog pages, oh and I want a date stamp to stamp on dates so you may notice some teeny gaps).

I'll post my thoughts on this project soon, as well as supplies used, so look out for that within the next day or two.

For some close-ups/details you can see all of <a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/tag/scrapbook/" target="_blank">my scrapbook posts here</a>.

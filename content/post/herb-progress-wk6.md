They survived!! After 2 weeks away in Cardiff I came back to my flat to find my herbs hadn't died. In fact, the soil from the chives and basil was still nice and moist. As you can see from the pics they aren't looking too great though.

The parsley in particular has gone quite wild. I wish I thinned that out earlier on since it's all knotted together now. Not really sure what to do with the chives either. The basil on the other hand is looking fine, I'm tempted to thin it down to just one plant (moving the far right big one in to the middle of the pot) but then I might end up with nothing left...

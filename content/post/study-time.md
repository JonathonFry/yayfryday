<p style="text-align: center;">2 weeks today = my first exam of four...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4 weeks today = Christmas holidays begin!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The countdown begins, and until then I shall drink lots of tea and eat lots of sugary snacks to keep me going through revision. These are my penultimate exams at university so I'm starting to stress, but I'm looking forward to getting them done and driving back home to Cardiff for Christmas :)</p>

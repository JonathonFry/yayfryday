It’s Easter tomorrow, woo! So today I’ve been busy making cupcakes with my favourite things ever – mini eggs. I usually use a flake on them too but I didn’t buy any so they’re a bit less chocolatey than normal, but still just as tasty.

I used my <a title="New Icing Bag Set" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/tala-icing-bag-set/" target="_blank">Tala icing bag</a>, and tried out a different nozzle on the one cupcake – can you spot it? :p

Have you done any Easter inspired baking? I’d love to hear about your creations!

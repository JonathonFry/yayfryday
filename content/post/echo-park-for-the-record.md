<p style="text-align: left;">Today my <a href="http://www.echoparkpaper.com/collections/for-the-record/" target="_blank">Echo Park - For The Record</a> collection kit came and I'm so excited to use it. I love the patterns and colours, and the cute little scrabble letters and the bird and flower stickers... I could go on. I got the kit for around Â£15 online and you get a lot for the money. The kit contains 12 sheets of 12x12 paper, alphas and border stickers, and element stickers.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I just wish there was more time in the day to do scrapbooking, I get addicted to it once I start but I have uni work to catch up on first. The Wales v England 6 Nations rugby match is also on today so I shall be watching that, and I want to bake cupcakes today too.. better get started!!</p>

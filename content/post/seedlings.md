Yay! Some little seedlings have appeared a week after planting my <a title="Grow Your Own Herbs" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/grow-your-own-herbs/">Gardener's World Seeds</a>. The basil came up first and can already see I'll have to do quite a bit of thinning with those. Only 3 of my parsley seeds have sprouted, but that's better than none! The chives were the slowest to sprout, but now there are quite a few seedlings and they're growing up fast.

Hopefully they'll all keep on growing now...

For Jon's 22nd on Thursday we went on a little trip to Glasgow. We've lived in Edinburgh for nearly 3 years and still hadn't been across there even though it's so close. Jon had lots of bday cash to spend so Glasgow was a great choice with so many shops!

We got the <a href="http://www.citylink.co.uk/index.php" target="_blank">citylink</a> bus from Haymarket to Glasgow which only cost us £6 return with 20% student discount online and took around an hour. Such good timing when we went as the sun was out the whole time.

Jon bought a few things, pretty much everything from H&amp;M - I think we went to 4 different ones and multiple times too. I think he likes it there ha. I used my <a href="http://dwell.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dwell</a> free £20 voucher and chose a cookie type jar for the kitchen, it has a dog's head on the lid! Struggled a bit to find the shop, it was in the lovely Princes Square, but glad we found it in the end. We did a lot of walking around shops so it was nice stopping for a sitdown and drink - we both loved the passion burst drink at the Fuel Juice Bar - so refreshing.

We had dinner at T.G.I's and used our <a title="Free(ish) T.G.I Friday’s Juicy Burger" href="https://yayfryday.com/post/freeish-t-g-i-fridays-juicy-burger/" target="_blank">free burger vouchers</a>, so yummy!! I had the BBQ Smokehouse and Jon had the Monster Burger. We only paid for drinks and dessert, and I don't think I've eaten that much in a long time, we struggled to walk back to the hotel... So worth it though!!

We stayed overnight at the <a href="http://www.citizenm.com/glasgow/" target="_blank">citizenM hotel</a>, which was really nice and we had fun playing around with the remote that controls everything in the room, including the shower pod colour. Such a big comfy bed too we didn't wanna get up in the morning!

We didn't see much of Glasgow with such short time, but what we did see was great. We'd both like to go back and see some more :D

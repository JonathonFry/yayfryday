Blue skies, turquoise water, white sand beaches. At just under four hours drive from Edinburgh, the Silver Sands of Morar on Scotland's east coast can be reached.

We camped for two nights at [Sunnyside Croft](https://www.sunnysidetouringsite.co.uk/) which has direct access to a lovely beach with gorgeous sunset views. We walked a long stretch of the coast, ending just past Camusdarach Beach. There were lots of small sandy coves and most beaches we had to ourselves. We had dinner in a pub in Arisaig and ate ice creams whenever we had the chance. It somehow reached 26C whilst we were there in May. It did not feel like we we were still in Scotland!

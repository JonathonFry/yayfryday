After finishing my <a title="Breaking Bad Cross Stitch" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/09/10/breaking-bad-cross-stitch/" target="_blank">Breaking Bad cross stitch</a>, I really wanted to make another one and since I had leftover supplies I dove straight in. (I actually finished this cross stitch during Summer over a couple of days - it's taken me this long to get a hoop to frame it!). I was looking for something simple to sew and after searching pinterest decided on a curly ampersand.

After drawing out the plan on grid paper I got sewing and couldn't stop till it was finished! Very addictive. I really liked how it came out but was unsure how to frame it. Which brings me to this weekend when I finally decided to go and buy an 8" hoop. I painted it black for contrast (this was actually Jon's idea!) and it can now be displayed, finally...

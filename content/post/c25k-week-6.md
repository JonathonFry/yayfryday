<strong>When / Where / Weather:</strong> Saturday / Union Canal / sun

<strong>Comments: </strong>I'd heard some people say that this run is a struggle. After doing the 20 min run it seems like this one will be fine, but that confidence can mean running faster and lead to getting tired quicker. So I made sure to keep it steady and start off slowly, and it went really well. This run was the farthest and quickest of them all that we've recorded on the nike+ app, getting closer to that 5k!

<strong>When / Where / Weather:</strong> Tuesday / Union Canal / windy

<strong>Comments: </strong>On Monday I had my first exam in the morning, so instead we went for a run the next day. It was really windy and it made it quite hard to run on the way out. At around the halfway mark I had a bad stitch which made it a struggle and I felt so tired at the end of it. It makes me nervous for the 25 min run that's coming next!

<strong>When / Where / Weather:</strong> Thursday / Union Canal / rain

<strong>Comments: </strong>It rained today so no nike+. It started off really well, but between 12.5 and 20 mins was the hardest. We kept at a steady pace throughout and pushed through it. Felt good afterwards, and it's awesome to think that 6 weeks ago we were running a minute at a time. Only 3 weeks to go, and no more walking between runs from here on!

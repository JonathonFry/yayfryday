A few weeks ago Jon & I took a 2-night trip to Zermatt. It was our first trip to Switzerland together and it was beautiful. We flew cheap with Easyjet to Basel and travelled down to Zermatt by train using Swiss transfer tickets. We stayed in a lovely [airbnb studio apartment](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/869728) on the river with views of the Matterhorn.

The first two days (Friday & Saturday) were foggy and snowy & visiblity was very poor. On Friday evening we explored the car free village and cooked rösti with gruyere, finished off with swiss chocolate (of course ;)).

We woke up to heavy snow on Saturday.

We layered up for a full day out hiking, and checked which trails were open. We decided on the loop **Zermatt > Z'mutt > Furi > Zum See > Zermatt** for our first hike with a lunch stop at [Restaurant Zum See](http://chalet-altesse-restaurant-zumsee.ch/en/restaurant-zumsee-home/). 

The hike was a little tiring in parts (especially when the snow was blowing in our faces) but it was good to breathe in the fresh mountain air and do some exploring. A friendly ginger cat lead us from Z'mutt almost to Furi (we actually had to run away from it so it would stop walking with us...). If we stopped walking it would start meowing at us to hurry up! Lunch at Zum See was amazing, I ate croute au fromage with bacon and tomatoes (sooo good) and Jon had rösti with bacon and eggs.

In the afternoon we hiked **Zermatt > Findeln > Zermatt**. There were a lot of switchbacks and we had to dodge the tobogganers coming down the trail. It was a lovely walk and we made it back down just before sunset.

After a much needed bath in the evening we slept very well. The forecast was telling us that Sunday would be clear, so we set an alarm in anticipation of waking up and seeing the Matterhorn for the first time...

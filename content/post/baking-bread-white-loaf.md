Bread 1/15 : white loaf from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347122133&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Lorraine Pascale's Baking Made Easy</a>

Notes: I liked that it used a 'squidge' of honey rather than any sugar. After 10mins the loaf had already coloured as much as I wanted it to go so I covered the top with foil to stop it going any darker. For my first loaf it was nice and easy, although I really need to get a serrated knife!

Review: Lovely soft bread that tastes as good as a plain white loaf can. Great with butter or nutella, <em>especially when it's still warm</em>.

{ I chose this bread as my first loaf for its simplicity. I figured if there's no disasters with this then I can go ahead with my plan to bake 15 different breads by 2013. So here goes!}

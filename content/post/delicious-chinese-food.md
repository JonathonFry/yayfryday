Last night me and my friends were treated to a lovely chinese meal cooked by our chinese friend, Will. I was looking forward to seeing how it compared to the chinese food we have here, and a Friday night eating chinese food sounded perfect! Here's what we had:
<ul>
	<li>Kung Pao Chicken</li>
	<li>Chinese Pork Ribs</li>
	<li>Chinese Chicken Curry</li>
	<li>And a 'McFlurry' for desert made by Claire ;)</li>
</ul>
It was all really good! Will's speciality was the ribs, and they were amazing, the sauce was lovely to dip stuff in after we all devoured the ribs. Was all a lot better than any chinese takeaway I've had in Britain! I took some pics of the food before tucking in, they're not very good quality unfortunately and it's hard to make food like this look good in pics, but believe me it was all so good.

<p style="text-align: left;">Safe to say we were all stuffed by the end of it, and after some drinks and a few games of 'Fuzzy Duck' we went home and fell straight to sleep! Thank you Will :D</p>

Woah they're growing quick! Especially the parsley, since <a title="Seedlings" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/seedlings/">last week</a> there were only 3 measlyÂ seedlings there. The basil is starting to grow it's first 'true' leaves, which means I'll have to thin them out soon - I'm scared it'll result in them all dying though. Not really sure what to do with the chives either, any ideas? Tempted to just leave them grow but I don't want them to kill each other?! Hmm we'll see how they do for now!

Ibiza wasn't the first place that came to mind when I'd think of where to go for a family holiday to celebrate a surprise 60th birthday. But that's where we ended up going, and it turns out there's much more to this Balearic Island than partying - with beautiful sunsets, turquoise bays, and an old town with narrow streets that you can get lost in.

We stayed in a [6 bedroom villa](http://www.sunsetvillaibiza.com/) in Cala Salada. The villa was only a 15 minute walk to Cala Saladeta, a stunning beach that we had to ourselves if we were up early enough! We also hired a car which made getting about super easy.

Here are my highlights from our family trip to Ibiza.

Early morning walks to Cala Saladeta, having the beach to ourselves and watching the sun rise up over the hills. Beach hopping to Cala Comte and Cala d'Hort. A bit of off road driving and a walk to the Es Vedr√† viewpoint. Those views. Watching a thunderstorm over the Mediterranean Sea. Swimming in the pool every day.

Wandering amongst the cobbled streets and through the walls in Ibiza Old Town, Dalt Vila. Fresh lemonade with honey. Snorkelling. Listening to music and eating ice-cream at the Hippy Market. Celebrating a 60th birthday with a meal at [Tapas Ibiza Restaurant and Lounge Bar](http://www.tapasrestaurantibiza.com/). Watching the sunset on a speedboat.

I also used the [1 second everyday](http://1se.co/) app to record a video of our trip. I absolutely loved using the app and think it's a great, easy way to capture memories. Here's the final video.

On my birthday, Jon and I headed into town for lunch. I'd read great things about Papii on <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d2212342-Reviews-Papii-Edinburgh_Scotland.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a>Â and since it's in the top ten places to eat in Edinburgh it had to be tried!

And we were not disappointed.

Jon went with the lemon and coriander chicken sub and I had the mezzano, salami and olive melt. Washed down with a flat white coffee and a very merry berry smoothie. All sooo good. And the coffee art is awesome. Birthday lunches are my favourite and Papii made it even better.

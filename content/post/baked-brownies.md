Yesterday I baked these delicious brownies from <a href="http://www.browneyedbaker.com/2010/10/08/the-baked-brownie/" target="_blank">Brown Eyed Baker</a>, and oh they're good! They're so rich and dense and not cakey - just how I think they should be! And I love the thin crackly crust on top too. There's a lot of richness in them - 3 big bars of dark chocolate, almost a whole block of butter and 2cups of sugar (to make 24) - but if eaten in bite sized chunks they are sooo delicious! I ate mine warm with ice-cream, mmm...

Today is pancake day, so of course I had to make pancakes for breakfast :) Over the weekend I made the Martha Stewart pancakes which I wrote about <a title="Valentineâ€™s Baking and Craft Ideas" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/valentines-baking-and-craft-ideas/">here</a> and they were more American style and were <em>really</em> good! I usually make the thin type and generally follow <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/basicpancakeswithsuga_66226">this</a> recipe, although I only use 1 egg, and I made these today as I think they're quicker to make than American style. Sadly we've run out of nutella but I still had a couple of strawberries with sugar. Although the bag of sugar does seem to have a hole in the bottom as my kitchen floor was covered in it afterwards, oops :/

I've been spending a bit of my birthday money online and am currently waiting for my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tala-Icing-Bag-Nozzles-Booklet/dp/B002U5C4ZC/ref=sr_1_2?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329864909&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">Tala Icing Bag Set in Tin</a> so I can start baking cupcakes as I've lost part of my old icing bag set, and this one looks so cute in the tin! I'm also expecting my <a href="http://www.echoparkpaper.com/collections/for-the-record/" target="_blank">Echo Park For the Record</a> Paper Collection Kit to come soon, so I can continue scrapbooking, love the alphas and elements in this set. So hopefully they'll be here tomorrow!

I also just found out that last Thursday was apparently something called <a href="http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/90408,Poles-gorge-themselves-on-Fat-Thursday" target="_blank">Fat Thursday</a>, gutted I missed out on that one. It's a Polish tradition, an alternative to pancake day, where they basically eat a lot of doughnuts - I've marked it on my calender for next year!

Anyone celebrate Fat Thursday here? Seems like a good thing to celebrate :p

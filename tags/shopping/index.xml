&lt;p>My very first DSLR! YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a fantastic deal on the Nikon D3200, and after researching more in to it I felt I couldn&amp;rsquo;t let it pass by. I have so much to learn and I am super excited to begin. Time to read through the manual and play around a lot. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nikon-D3200-Snapshots-Great-Shots/dp/0321864433" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>This book&lt;/a> is also going on my wishlist. AHH!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Payday also brought me a new pair of shoes! I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying I&amp;rsquo;d buy a new pair since March when my boots broke. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing my ballet style shoes to work each day, and they were in desperate need of replacement. Each time it would rain (that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of times) I&amp;rsquo;d say that I&amp;rsquo;d buy a new pair of shoes at the weekend. 6 months later and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally done it with these tan leather shoes.&lt;/p>

>This blog&lt;/a> inspired me to finally go shopping after I read about the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.un-fancy.com/capsule-wardrobe-101/what-is-a-capsule-wardrobe-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>capsule wardrobe&lt;/a> idea. Two days later I was onboard and I sorted through everything, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I realised that I could no longer put off buying shoes, so the next day I went to Princes St. My feet will be so thankful, especially with all these rainy days. Time to sell/donate/get rid of lots of clothes and fill out my Autumn capsule some more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have a lovely weekend! I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to taking a large amount of photos&amp;hellip;!&lt;/p>

I had a fantastic one :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, as I share my birthday with 2 friends (they&amp;rsquo;re twins!), we all went out in Edinburgh to celebrate. I bought a new dress with my birthday cash from ASOS, this one to be precise:&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/bdaydress.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1524" alt="bdaydress" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/bdaydress.jpg" width="490" height="625" />&lt;/a>

which I loved :) Of course, I painted my nails too in my new &lt;a title="Nails in Coralicious" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/03/02/nails-in-coralicious/">Coralicious polish&lt;/a>, love the bright colour against the black and white print.

&lt;p>During the day Jon took me for &lt;a title="Lunch at Papii" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/02/12/lunch-at-papii/" target="_blank">lunch at Papii&lt;/a>, I popped in to uni for a couple of classes then returned home for a chinese takeaway. I also received lots of cool gifts, here&amp;rsquo;s a couple I just had to share (excuse the lack of lighting!)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/travelbook.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1535" alt="travelbook" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/travelbook.jpg" width="490" height="903" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. The Travel Book: A Journey Through Every Country in the World.&lt;/strong> Where to go next&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;d love to travel around South America, especially Peru!&lt;/p>

I ordered everything online except my jacket, and it all came within 3 days!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First up here&amp;rsquo;s my &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com" target="_blank">Topshop&lt;/a> haul. It all came to £45.40 incl the £4 delivery. I managed to get student discount, and the 10% even came off sale items! So those jeans only cost me £9 :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/topshop.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044" title="topshophaul" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/topshop.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="370" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Clockwise from left: &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4379980&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=02A29BCAM&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">MOTO HIGH WAISTED KRISTEN&lt;/a> // &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=1903240&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=42V30XSAL&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">SALMON BALLET PUMPS&lt;/a> // &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4920043&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=09M07AWHT&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">COTTON LYCRA TUNIC&lt;/a> // &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4738874&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=27M02APLE&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">FLORAL SKIRT&lt;/a> // &lt;a title="Nails in Pool Party" href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=2412181&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;parent_category_rn=&amp;amp;searchTerm=20N01ZAQA&amp;amp;resultCount=1" target="_blank">NAILS IN POOL PARTY&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;em>&lt;/em>I am pleased with everything. My favourite thing has to be the jeans, they fit really well. I blogged already about the nail polish &lt;a title="Nails in Pool Party" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/nails-in-pool-party/" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">After browsing Topshop I had to check out the &lt;a href="http://www.asos.com/" target="_blank">ASOS&lt;/a> sale. Lots of bargains to be found there! Unfortunately lots of things I wanted weren't available in my size. But I managed to get these jeans in indigo, and they fit perfectly, another great price. ASOS also offers free delivery and student discount (but not on sale items) too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/asos.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1048 aligncenter" title="asos" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/asos.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="369" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Finally, after work I popped in to some shops looking for a jacket. I managed to pick one up at &lt;a href="http://www.zara.com" target="_blank">Zara&lt;/a>. It wasn't on sale but I really liked it and it feels like it'll last. Plus I needed one as I only really have a winter coat at the moment and seeing as it's July I could really do with something a bit lighter. It cost me £40, eek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately I can't seem to find it online, so here's a pic I took of my shopping haul with the jacket included!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/IMGP3245-2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1050" title="shopping" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/IMGP3245-2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="308" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
So that's how I managed to spend most of my money... Have you picked out anything in the summer sales?

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;del>started to spend&lt;/del> spent all of the £100 that I won from Uni which I mentioned &lt;a title="Taste of Edinburgh Cancelled…" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/taste-of-edinburgh-cancelled/">here&lt;/a>. Something that I wanted to buy was a new nail varnish and I decided on &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=2412181&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;searchTerm=Pool&amp;amp;pageSize=20" target="_blank">this one&lt;/a> from Topshop in Pool Party. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely, bright and glossy turquoisey blue - great for summer! I only own pinks, reds and neutral nail polishes so it was good to get something totally different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I only put it on today so I can&amp;rsquo;t comment on how long it&amp;rsquo;ll last, although at work my nails chip &lt;em>a lot &lt;/em>so I&amp;rsquo;m not expecting too much, but it was nice and thick and feels good quality. In the photo I only have one coat on and no top coat so it&amp;rsquo;s not completely opaque. It&amp;rsquo;s my first Topshop nail varnish and I already want more, they have so many good colours! It cost £5 but as a student with 10% off it came down to £4.50 ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along with my new nail polish I bought lots of clothes. I rarely buy clothes, usually just after Christmas and my birthday, but when I do I tend to buy them all in one go.  I&amp;rsquo;m definitely more of a saver than a spender. I may post about what I bought tomorrow :D&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My washi tape and labels from &lt;a href="http://freckledfawn.com/" target="_blank">Freckled Fawn&lt;/a> arrived this very morning, and so far I likey! I finally own washi tape, and now I must use it&amp;hellip; Yep I already feel the need to get more. Especially since they keep updating their stock with new products!&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/freckledfawn.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-949 aligncenter" title="freckledfawn" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/freckledfawn.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="336" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
Woo!! I treated myself to some lovely washi tape from &lt;a href="http://freckledfawn.com/" target="_blank">Freckled Fawn&lt;/a>. I couldn't resist since it's just been my first payday, and also because readers of &lt;a href="http://aliedwards.com/blog" target="_blank">Ali Edwards' blog&lt;/a> were offered free shipping. Perfect timing!
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve browsed Freckled Fawn many times, thinking as it&amp;rsquo;s American and priced in $ the shipping would be expensive. So I went ahead and chose the above three products, coming to $10.05 - paypal charging me £6.66, a great price for these items especially since they are coming all the way from the US. I later found that the shipping would have only cost me $2.30, very reasonable so this would no longer discourage me from buying from over there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have wanted to purchase washi tape for a while now, it&amp;rsquo;s so pretty with lots of uses. Here are (some of) my top picks from Freckled Fawn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/washitapes.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954" title="washitapes" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/washitapes.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="518" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I am so excited for it to arrive, I have a feeling I will become addicted though; there are so many cute patterns and colours!!&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Edinburgh for nearly 3 years and still hadn&amp;rsquo;t been across there even though it&amp;rsquo;s so close. Jon had lots of bday cash to spend so Glasgow was a great choice with so many shops!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP29181.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-718" title="Glasgow trip" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP29181.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="2369" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
We got the &lt;a href="http://www.citylink.co.uk/index.php" target="_blank">citylink&lt;/a> bus from Haymarket to Glasgow which only cost us £6 return with 20% student discount online and took around an hour. Such good timing when we went as the sun was out the whole time.
&lt;p>Jon bought a few things, pretty much everything from H&amp;amp;M - I think we went to 4 different ones and multiple times too. I think he likes it there ha. I used my &lt;a href="http://dwell.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dwell&lt;/a> free £20 voucher and chose a cookie type jar for the kitchen, it has a dog&amp;rsquo;s head on the lid! Struggled a bit to find the shop, it was in the lovely Princes Square, but glad we found it in the end. We did a lot of walking around shops so it was nice stopping for a sitdown and drink - we both loved the passion burst drink at the Fuel Juice Bar - so refreshing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had dinner at T.G.I&amp;rsquo;s and used our &lt;a title="Free(ish) T.G.I Friday’s Juicy Burger" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/freeish-t-g-i-fridays-juicy-burger/" target="_blank">free burger vouchers&lt;/a>, so yummy!! I had the BBQ Smokehouse and Jon had the Monster Burger. We only paid for drinks and dessert, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten that much in a long time, we struggled to walk back to the hotel&amp;hellip; So worth it though!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stayed overnight at the &lt;a href="http://www.citizenm.com/glasgow/" target="_blank">citizenM hotel&lt;/a>, which was really nice and we had fun playing around with the remote that controls everything in the room, including the shower pod colour. Such a big comfy bed too we didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna get up in the morning!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We didn&amp;rsquo;t see much of Glasgow with such short time, but what we did see was great. We&amp;rsquo;d both like to go back and see some more :D&lt;/p>

With a whole load of accessories included - Yipee!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-deluxe-kit.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-647" title="diana deluxe kit" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-deluxe-kit.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="390" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at toy cameras for a while now. I like that they are plastic, light and use film. I particularly love the Diana F+ from Lomography, I love the outcome of the photos and not knowing how they&amp;rsquo;ll come out until the film is developed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Me and Jon split the cost between us because we both wanted it so bad and for £50 each it&amp;rsquo;s a great deal. Luckily Jon worked his eBay magic and managed to get us the &lt;a href="http://microsites.lomography.com/diana/accessories/diana-deluxe-kit" target="_blank">Diana Deluxe Kit &lt;/a>for just £100 incl. p&amp;amp;p.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the main features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Diana F+&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diana Flash&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hot shoe adaptors (one for camera, one for flash)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cable Release Collar and cable release&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Splitzer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diana 35mm Back + 4 masks for 4 formats&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-f+.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-651" title="diana f+" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-f+.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="698" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately I don&amp;rsquo;t have any film yet so haven&amp;rsquo;t had a play, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got to admire all the parts and work out how everything works. We&amp;rsquo;re gonna try 35mm film first as it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper and more available, then when we&amp;rsquo;ve more experience we&amp;rsquo;ll try the 120mm. I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to get snapping and try out lots of different things, although I&amp;rsquo;m sure the first roll of film we have developed will be terrible but I&amp;rsquo;d enjoy it all the same!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With all these bits there&amp;rsquo;s nothing more I could want from this camera :D Jon&amp;rsquo;s most excited to use the Fisheye and I just can&amp;rsquo;t wait for everything, just wanna get outside now! Although there is something I shall add to my wishlist&amp;hellip; the &lt;a href="http://microsites.lomography.com/diana/accessories/diana-instant-back" target="_blank">Instant back&lt;/a> so it can be used like a polaroid - amazing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what d&amp;rsquo;ya think of my new toy? Do you have a toy camera or thinking of getting one?&lt;/p>

I wanna have lots of different coloured and sized ones to put sweets, crisps, dip, popcorn and anything in. I love watching movies with a load of them filled with a selection of stuff that I can pick and choose from. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just that I&amp;rsquo;m lazy and like to eat sweets - it&amp;rsquo;s easier to get to them when they&amp;rsquo;re not in a packet. But I could say it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;portion control&amp;rsquo; instead ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sadly my cupboards in the kitchen are teeny so I can only have a couple, but I enjoy window shopping for bowls almost as much as owning them. Is that weird?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few of my current favourites a long with some cute bento boxes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: right;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/bowls-and-bento-boxes.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-576 aligncenter" title="bowls and bento boxes" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/bowls-and-bento-boxes.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1162" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">[/ordered_list]&lt;/p>
As well as bowls, I want to own a Bento box. I think they are so cool with compartments and stuff and not clunky like lunch boxes which hardly fit in my bag. I especially like the Aladdin one seen above as it's fully sealable and can store both hot or cold food and keep it that way. Although i'd get the smaller size, this one can be for Jon! I don't enjoy lunch at uni because it's normally a squashed sandwich, but with a bento box I think I'd experiment a lot more and take pasta, couscous etc with me - so much better!
&lt;p>So anyone else like me that loves bowls? Or maybe its spoons or dessert plates? (Both of which I love btw)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday we both volunteered at the &lt;a title="Rock ‘n’ Roll Edinburgh Half Marathon" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/rock-n-roll-edinburgh-half-marathon/">Rock &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; Roll Edinburgh Half Marathon&lt;/a>, which was really fun and it was such a nice sunny day. We were over at Holyrood park all morning and after holding rope for the corral starts we ate hotdogs before the runners started to come through the finish line with the female winner after 1hr 16mins! We were working at the chip retrieval where we clipped the chips off people shoes, yum. Was a great day, maybe some time we&amp;rsquo;ll be running it :p&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards we went to Usher Hall to see &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lwxj1/features/banglive" target="_blank">Bang Goes the Theory Live&lt;/a> (not to be confused with the Big Bang Theory)! We managed to get free tickets and it was pretty good. Lots of kids though and I was sat by a boy who couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop jumping up and down in his seat so I was flinging around lol, that was quite annoying after a while&amp;hellip; Was an entertaining show though for all the family and educational too, and the audience were involved which the kids loved. It was my first time inside Usher Hall and it&amp;rsquo;s a really nice venue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Monday - Wednesday Jon had family up to visit which was lovely. It&amp;rsquo;s so good when we have visitors, sucks we are so far away! They were staying in an amazing apartment right in town with heated floors which were so nice and even a garden. Hate how cold our flat is :( There was this mirror in the lounge which I love:&lt;/p>
&lt;img class="aligncenter" title="mirror" src="http://media-cache2.pinterest.com/upload/26529085275208448_hmRtjSl6_f.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="309" />
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s made of magazine pages rolled up in to squares. So I had a look at how to make it and found lots of other things to make with magazine paper which &lt;a href="http://pinterest.com/sarahls12/craft-ideas/" target="_blank">I pinned on Pinterest&lt;/a> (so addictive!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before Jon&amp;rsquo;s family had to leave back to Cardiff we had free cocktails at the &lt;a href="http://www.therutlandhotel.com/bar-rutland-hotel-2.htm" target="_blank">Rutland Hotel Bar&lt;/a> :D They were so good - in order of yummiest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>42 Ways to Leave Your Lover&lt;/strong> &lt;em>- 42 Below Kiwi, Cointreau, mango juice, citrus and basil combine for a long cool thirst quencher.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lemon and Lychee Caipiroska&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>Sharp and tangy with a hint of tropical sweetness, Absolut Citron and lychee juice combine for an exciting twist on a classic.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Crimson Kisses&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>A romantic blend of fresh raspberries, Bombay Sapphire, rose liqueur &amp;amp; sparkling rose wine.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Rutland Mai-Ta&lt;/strong> - &lt;em>Classic Mai-Tai recipe made with our Rutland rum blend, fresh lime and Grand Marnier.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
Would definitely go back there for more!
&lt;p>We also had a wander around the shops, and went to &lt;a href="http://www.anthropologie.eu/" target="_blank">Anthropologie&lt;/a> which I&amp;rsquo;d never been to before but Jon&amp;rsquo;s parents had been whilst in the US. It&amp;rsquo;s such a nice shop, pretty expensive, but they had a sale! Jon&amp;rsquo;s Mum found this plate and we had to get it, down to £3 from £12:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/purple-plate.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-554" title="purple plate" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/purple-plate.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="630" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now they&amp;rsquo;ve gone back we are sad they&amp;rsquo;ve gone and we have to get back to studying. Revision plan has kicked back in and my first exam is this Tuesday&amp;hellip; :/ Starting to stress but thing like tea, cake and highlighters make it all a bit better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/uni-work.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-555" title="uni work" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/uni-work.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s my week so far. The rest will be a nice evening tonight then stuck at my desk trying to get all this revision in to my head. I shall be sleeping with symbols in my dreams.&lt;/p>

Hope you&amp;rsquo;ve all had a lovely day :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed spending time doing no uni work at all :). Last week I had a test and 2 projects due in so I was working all day and night for all of that, so I decided this weekend would be a chilled out one! Friday night involved watching 3 hours of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108941/" target="_blank">The Stand&lt;/a>, Saturday was a crafty day and today was a beautiful sunny day so I went to town with my boyfriend for a wander and used my birthday vouchers to get a few goodies!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scrapbooking&lt;/strong>. On Saturday I continued on my scrapbook which is starting to get a lot bigger. I&amp;rsquo;m scrapping my trip to the US that me and my boyfriend took last summer, gives me holiday blues so much. I will blog about my scrapbook more when it&amp;rsquo;s finished. It&amp;rsquo;s my first attempt at making a scrapbook so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to some people&amp;rsquo;s, but I love this way of keeping my memories!  I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get the pages together first and then do the journaling after, so some pages are quite plain at the mo. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peak!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-400 aligncenter" title="Scrapbook Grand Canyon" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">2. &lt;strong>Shopping&lt;/strong>. Today I used up most of my birthday vouchers and had a walk around Edinburgh in the sunshine. I managed to pick up the following, and I'm so excited by it all!&lt;/p>
[gallery link="file" order="DESC" orderby="post_date" exclude="400, 399"]
&lt;p>Look how cute those &lt;a href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/pens-+amp-pencils/panda-highlighters-pack-of-5/invt/00485861/">panda highlighters&lt;/a> are?! I love Paperchase stationery, just wish it was a bit better for the budget. I got that 17 &lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/en/17-Fast-Finish-Nail-Polish_927316/" target="_blank">nail polish&lt;/a> from Boots in &amp;lsquo;Pink Lemonade&amp;rsquo;, will try it out tonight - looks lovely and fresh like summer! Went to The Works too and picked up a canvas for £2.99 - bargain!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then popped into Waterstones to use my book vouchers. I had looked online for some ideas before I went as I know I&amp;rsquo;d be in there for ages trying to decide between them all! Firstly I bought &lt;a href="http://www.sjwatson-books.com/beforeigotosleep/about/" target="_blank">Before I Go to Sleep&lt;/a> by S. J. Watson - &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Memories define us. So what if you lost yours every time you went to sleep?&lt;/em> An original, haunting, and deeply chilling debut.&amp;rdquo; I enjoy reading books like this and this one sounds particularly interesting, the boyfriend fancies having a read of this after me too. Then I bought &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You&lt;/a> by Jojo Moyes - a girly book, don&amp;rsquo;t think the boyfriend will read this one :p. I wanted to also buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pink-Hotel-Anna-Stothard/dp/1846881315" target="_blank">The Pink Hotel&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Into-Darkest-Corner-Elizabeth-Haynes/dp/0956251579/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1332094500&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Into the Darkest Corner&lt;/a>, but they&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been up to this weekend? Enjoying the sun where you are?&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Today my &lt;a href="http://www.echoparkpaper.com/collections/for-the-record/" target="_blank">Echo Park - For The Record&lt;/a> collection kit came and I'm so excited to use it. I love the patterns and colours, and the cute little scrabble letters and the bird and flower stickers... I could go on. I got the kit for around £15 online and you get a lot for the money. The kit contains 12 sheets of 12x12 paper, alphas and border stickers, and element stickers.&lt;/p>
[gallery exclude="276, 277" link="file"]
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I just wish there was more time in the day to do scrapbooking, I get addicted to it once I start but I have uni work to catch up on first. The Wales v England 6 Nations rugby match is also on today so I shall be watching that, and I want to bake cupcakes today too.. better get started!!&lt;/p>

This afternoon the postie came and delivered my new Tala icing bag set, and I love the look of it. The tin is really cute and handy to keep all the bits together. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose any like I did with my old set and there&amp;rsquo;s also enough room (if you take out the packaging) to store more bits and pieces. It looks really good quality, just excited to try it out now. So plans for this weekend shall include baking cupcakes, my boyfriend will be happy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2438.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-243 aligncenter" title="IMGP2438" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2438-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
I bought it from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002U5C4ZC/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=103612307&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=B000EUKOMA&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=17E9952TCET6ZSFR68AP" target="_blank">Amazon&lt;/a> and cost me £9.98, which is quite expensive but for the quality and look (and birthday cash) I think it's worth it.

Which is why I have taken so long to write a post on here as I&amp;rsquo;ve been so busy, but now I have a bit of time I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a post about it. Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my boyfriend, family and friends for the lovely cards and gifts and for those that could make it out on the night!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a couple of weeks back my boyfriend asked me for some birthday ideas, and I found some jewellery that had been blogged about &lt;a href="http://sweetmondayblog.blogspot.com/">here&lt;/a> that I really wanted. Then when my birthday came and I opened my presents I was surprised to receive these two from him that I love :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly is a necklace from &lt;a href="http://www.wallpaperrose.bigcartel.com/">Wallpaper Rose&lt;/a> which is so cool as it  has a clock inside, and was prettily packaged with a bow. Wallpaper Rose is worth a look, I want more haha!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2333.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-139 aligncenter" title="IMGP2333" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2333-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2336.jpg">&lt;img class="wp-image-137" title="IMGP2336" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2336-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Secondly was this cute little friendship bracelet from &lt;a href="http://lilyloveslola.bigcartel.com/">Lily Loves Lola&lt;/a>. I'd recommend this shop, there are lots of different bracelets all at a good price of just £2.50 each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2339.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138" title="IMGP2339" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2339-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">[hr]&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">The Saturday wasn't just my birthday, it was also 2 of my friends birthdays too. So we all went out to Hive (classy.. :/) but it's so cheap there and we always have a good time! So of course I had to do my nails :) I decided to paint them with Avon mirror shine in bronze, which I've owned for years but hardly worn, and Barry M black crackle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2351.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-140" title="IMGP2351" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2351-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2353.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-141" title="IMGP2353" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2353-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I like the way they turned out and matched my dress. My dress was from &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4212208&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId&amp;amp;searchTerm=SEQUIN|&amp;amp;pageSize=20&amp;amp;fb_source=message#13276692761531&amp;amp;country:undefined^language:undefined^currencySymbol:undefined^preferredUrl:undefined^siteLabel:undefined^langId:undefined^storeId:undefined^salesCatalogId:undefined^viewed:undefined^explicit:undefined" target="_blank">Topshop&lt;/a> and was only £15 in the sale, and although the sequins rubbed my arm a bit, I really liked it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/Dress.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-143" title="Dress" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/Dress-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">So that's my birthday done for a year and next up is Valentine's day, time is flying by! We managed to grab some Titanic 3D tickets for tomorrow and I am so glad I kept checking for them, be persistent and hope for cancellations if you want to see it. Hope you all have a lovely day filled with love and chocolate :)&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s such a big book that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I could finish it. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad I chose a big project to put together for my first scrapbook as I learnt lots along the way. I started from the beginning and went through page by page, I think the improvements can be seen as the book progresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/travel-scrapbook2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1299" title="travel scrapbook" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/travel-scrapbook2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="276" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always had making a scrapbook of the trip in my mind, so I made sure to keep hold of all those little bits and pieces whilst travelling to include in the book. This included the usual things like leaflets, receipts, menus, tickets, napkins, wristbands, tags, as well as random stuff like a drink stirrer and paper hat. Cool to look back on and great fillers too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/favouritepages.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1289" title="favouritepages" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/favouritepages.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="734" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pages above are my favourites. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because of the colours and how the pages are filled without looking cluttered. I also like the circle cut of the middle page to keep the pages flowing together. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just because they feature doughnuts and ice-cream&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/pocket1.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1292" title="pocket" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/10/pocket1.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are quite a few pockets in the book which I struggled with at the start. Towards the end I found what worked best for me, and this was cutting down half a page and using the scrap to make a pocket to stick back on to the half page. It seems to be the sturdiest and it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier to turn the page. For the pocket above I painted it black and cut out a window which I then covered in acetate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My next scrapbook I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of making is a minibook, perhaps 4x6 - a lot smaller and manageable that way!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Supplies: Fancy Pants patterned paper (it&amp;rsquo;s the little things), American Crafts remarks stickers, Echo Park collection kit (for the record), Paperchase travel stickers, Freckled Fawn washi tape. I used a &lt;a href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/invt/00333125/" target="_blank">Paperchase kraft scrapbook&lt;/a> as the base, and Dovecraft adhesive runners and a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pilot-Rollerball-Rubber-Retractable-0-5mm/dp/B0027IXR8K/ref=wl_it_dp_o_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;colid=366HG8GNNQRHA&amp;amp;coliid=I1LW4TNRBEVZRJ" target="_blank">Pilot G205 pen&lt;/a> throughout the book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scrapbook: Road Trip USA</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/scrapbook-road-trip-usa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2012 17:56:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/scrapbook-road-trip-usa/</guid><description>&lt;p>{Photo heavy post} It&amp;rsquo;s finally finished!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since Jon and I &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2011/07/23/road-trip-usa/" target="_blank">went to the US&lt;/a>, and now the scrapbook is done! Here is the complete final book (minus all of the printed out blog pages, oh and I want a date stamp to stamp on dates so you may notice some teeny gaps).&lt;/p>

I'll post my thoughts on this project soon, as well as supplies used, so look out for that within the next day or two.

&lt;p>Firstly I wanted to show how thick this scrapbook has become. I&amp;rsquo;ve been changing things (like re-making pockets out of thinner paper) to make it a bit thinner as it has struggled to close, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty impressed by how much has fitted into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/thickness.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1149" title="thickness" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/thickness.jpg" width="490" height="613" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve gone back to the beggining of the book to add a couple pages on the planning stages of the trip, just a few pages cut out of the moleskine I was using to plan, some snaps of things like our &amp;lsquo;important items to be packed&amp;rsquo; and a map of our planned route.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/plans.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1150" title="plans" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/plans.jpg" width="490" height="485" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve added journalling to roughly a quarter of the pages so still have a lot more to do with that. I&amp;rsquo;ve realised now that I should&amp;rsquo;ve just printed off the blog posts and stuck those in within the pages, but hey that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt and that&amp;rsquo;s what I would do in the future. For now I shall continue with it, the journalling spots aren&amp;rsquo;t big ones they&amp;rsquo;re just little snippets of what we did on that day so hopefully won&amp;rsquo;t take too much longer to complete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did want to include the&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/category/usa-road-trip/" target="_blank"> blog posts&lt;/a> in the book, so I just put together the pages on Photoshop Elements and printed them on card and stuck them in at the back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/blogprints.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151" title="blogprints" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/08/blogprints.jpg" width="490" height="588" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are still a few pages at the very back where I&amp;rsquo;ll probably stick in something to hold stuff I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put in the book, and a  DVD of all our photos and our roadtrip playlist. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to finish it up and to move on to my next project&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

I picked up another one from &lt;a href="http://www.shoppapertiger.com/" target="_blank">Paper Tiger&lt;/a> which is only a 10min walk  away (great shop btw for supplies, cards and gifts) and have now been able to finish the main body of my scrapbook!

I think I only have like 2 more pages to do before I go back and tidy up some of the earlier pages, add a few simple pages to the beginning and ends (I&amp;rsquo;m going to print out the blog posts we wrote whilst on the road and stick them in at the end), then finally get round to journalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the pages I finished today, it looks pretty cluttered but I think looking at the pages as a whole it&amp;rsquo;s not so crazy. Although these couple of days in LA were rather hectic!&lt;/p>

Things slowed down recently as I was doing lots of overtime at work and I felt a couple of photos were missing from my stash to use in the book. But now work has calmed down and my awesome mum gave me an awesome printer so I can get going with it some more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I finished up 3 pages, all of our journey along the Pacific Coast. I cut one of the pages into a semi-circle so all these pages &amp;lsquo;fit in&amp;rsquo; together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/scrappeek7.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1072" title="scrappeek7" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/scrappeek7.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="778" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to finish it and start journalling and sharing it with you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today it was (partially) sunny outside and whilst scrapbooking I watched the birds, ate some flapjack that I made last night and drank cups of tea. I love this project!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished San Francisco and I&amp;rsquo;m now on to the coast. Just Los Angeles to go after that. I&amp;rsquo;ve started to go back to the beginning and add some things to my first few pages which were pretty plain as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have many supplies back when I began the scrapbook. It&amp;rsquo;s good to see the progress in how much I&amp;rsquo;ve improved since I started!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting the hang of making my pockets to hold stuff sturdily, again by cutting a page in half. I even painted this one &lt;em>and&lt;/em> cut a rectangle out to show the Alcatraz logo-image-thingy and stuck some acetate film in its place, fancy ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still on San Francisco and have a couple of pages still to do here, then only around 5days of the trip left to go before I will get journalling.&lt;/p>

As I still haven&amp;rsquo;t learnt to drive, I&amp;rsquo;m usually the navigator. Road trips are one of mine and Jon&amp;rsquo;s top favourite things to do, being able to get in a car and drive wherever the road takes us and finding new places to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we first came to Edinburgh we spent a lot of time driving around the coast and planning little day trips. Unfortunately we no longer have a car in Edinburgh, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford it, and it&amp;rsquo;s something we miss a lot to be able to just go for a drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst road tripping in the US, we had &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rand-McNally-Road-Atlas-United/dp/0528003364/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1339592973&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">this great mapbook&lt;/a> in the car with us that I used to get us around. We did consider a GPS/using internet but thought a paper map won&amp;rsquo;t tell us to go the wrong way (that would be my responsibility..) and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about signal and having to spend extra money. The mapbook successfully didn&amp;rsquo;t get us lost whilst out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been looking up ways to display maps as artwork , and I found &lt;a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/375160/map-artwork" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> thanks to Martha Stewart (instructions in the link). This is a perfect way to display a road trip!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/map-frames.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845" title="map-frames" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/map-frames.jpg" width="490" height="306" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I&amp;rsquo;ll do a large map of the West of the US and sew on our road trip and frame it like above :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So yesterday I had a little play with a free map I picked up in San Francisco. I hand sewn on the route that we took of a day we spent sightseeing (&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/day-17-san-fran-sights/" target="_blank">this one&lt;/a>) and put an X where we began and ended - the San Remo Hotel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/sewn-map.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846" title="sewn map" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/sewn-map.jpg" width="490" height="551" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having completed this I&amp;rsquo;m eager to sew the big road trip next. I stuck this San Francisco map in to my scrapbook and I think it looks pretty good!&lt;/p>

(And I had an 8-letter word but no R on the board - typical!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrabble.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816" title="scrabble" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrabble.jpg" width="490" height="183" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve made some more progress with my travel scrapbook too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapbook-4.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823" title="scrapbook 4" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/scrapbook-4.jpg" width="490" height="720" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m finally on to &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm" target="_blank">Yosemite NP&lt;/a>, such amazing scenery there we both loved it, a definite must-see if in CA!! I have a lot of pics to fill the next few pages with, and this time I cut one of the pages in half to put the envelope on that holds the leaflets, etc in and it&amp;rsquo;s much sturdier that way (other side shown in the bottom pic painted purple). Wish I did this from the start!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what things do you like to do on a rainy day?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>{Scrapbook peeks are little glimpses of the scrapbook I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together of a &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/category/usa-road-trip" target="_blank">road trip in the US &lt;/a>from last summer. Here are my previous peeks: &lt;a title="A Chilled Out Weekend" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/a-chilled-out-weekend/">#1&lt;/a>, &lt;a title="Scrapbook Peek #2" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/scrapbook-peek-2/">#2&lt;/a>, &lt;a title="Life Lately" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/life-lately/">#3&lt;/a>}&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Life Lately</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/life-lately/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2012 19:25:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/life-lately/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have finally finished 3rd year - yay! My final exam was on Monday so I&amp;rsquo;m done with uni for 4 whole months - summer has begun! But sadly the weather isn&amp;rsquo;t agreeing with me on that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/hail.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-672" title="hail" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/hail.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="346" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from the bad weather (it&amp;rsquo;s Britain after all) I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying not having to revise anymore and having time to catch up on tv, etc. This currently consists of HIMYM (ah season finale :o), Gossip Girl (another season finale!), Glee (yes I&amp;rsquo;m a fan), Game of Thrones (crazy), and I&amp;rsquo;ve started rewatching The Shield (watch it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also been busy with my scrapbook and managed to complete 3 pages yesterday. Any guesses at to where these photos were taken? ;) My &lt;strong>scrapbook peek #3&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/scrapbook-3.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-673" title="scrapbook 3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/scrapbook-3.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1019" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally I&amp;rsquo;ve put film in my &lt;a title="My New Diana F+ Camera" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/my-new-diana-f-camera/">new camera&lt;/a> and have started snapping away. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get it developed even if they do turn out bad..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-viewfinder.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-674" title="diana viewfinder" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/diana-viewfinder.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="431" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now I&amp;rsquo;ve got more time on my hands I shall be filling my moleskine up with things I want to do and ideas for the blog. Hopefully things will be getting ticked off a lot more frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and sorry about the amount of brackets used in this post, got a bit carried away!&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;m almost halfway through the trip and I&amp;rsquo;ve loved making it and reminding myself of all the good memories we had there. I&amp;rsquo;ve not done any journalling in it yet as I still don&amp;rsquo;t have an acid free pen, but I think once all the pics and bits are in then I&amp;rsquo;ll go through and fill in all the blanks! It&amp;rsquo;ll be so great to look through in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here&amp;rsquo;s a little peek at a couple of pages I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on recently (sorry about the poor lighting):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2814.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-634" title="usa scrapbook1" alt="" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/05/IMGP2814.jpg" width="490" height="996" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes that&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a title="Free Fabric Samples" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/free-fabric-samples/" target="_blank">free fabric sample&lt;/a> I got in the last pic there :) If you&amp;rsquo;re interested me and Jon kept a blog whilst on our roadtrip that&amp;rsquo;s over &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/category/usa-road-trip" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have you been on a roadtrip around the US or planning one? I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. I&amp;rsquo;ve got some exciting camera news I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to sharing with you soon!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Chilled Out Weekend</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/a-chilled-out-weekend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2012 18:07:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/a-chilled-out-weekend/</guid><description>&lt;p>Firstly I just want to say Happy mother&amp;rsquo;s day, in particular to my Mum! Hope you&amp;rsquo;ve all had a lovely day :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed spending time doing no uni work at all :). Last week I had a test and 2 projects due in so I was working all day and night for all of that, so I decided this weekend would be a chilled out one! Friday night involved watching 3 hours of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108941/" target="_blank">The Stand&lt;/a>, Saturday was a crafty day and today was a beautiful sunny day so I went to town with my boyfriend for a wander and used my birthday vouchers to get a few goodies!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scrapbooking&lt;/strong>. On Saturday I continued on my scrapbook which is starting to get a lot bigger. I&amp;rsquo;m scrapping my trip to the US that me and my boyfriend took last summer, gives me holiday blues so much. I will blog about my scrapbook more when it&amp;rsquo;s finished. It&amp;rsquo;s my first attempt at making a scrapbook so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to some people&amp;rsquo;s, but I love this way of keeping my memories!  I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get the pages together first and then do the journaling after, so some pages are quite plain at the mo. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peak!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-400 aligncenter" title="Scrapbook Grand Canyon" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2584.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-399 aligncenter" title="Scrapbook Monument Valley" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2584-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">2. &lt;strong>Shopping&lt;/strong>. Today I used up most of my birthday vouchers and had a walk around Edinburgh in the sunshine. I managed to pick up the following, and I'm so excited by it all!&lt;/p>
[gallery link="file" order="DESC" orderby="post_date" exclude="400, 399"]
&lt;p>Look how cute those &lt;a href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/pens-+amp-pencils/panda-highlighters-pack-of-5/invt/00485861/">panda highlighters&lt;/a> are?! I love Paperchase stationery, just wish it was a bit better for the budget. I got that 17 &lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/en/17-Fast-Finish-Nail-Polish_927316/" target="_blank">nail polish&lt;/a> from Boots in &amp;lsquo;Pink Lemonade&amp;rsquo;, will try it out tonight - looks lovely and fresh like summer! Went to The Works too and picked up a canvas for £2.99 - bargain!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then popped into Waterstones to use my book vouchers. I had looked online for some ideas before I went as I know I&amp;rsquo;d be in there for ages trying to decide between them all! Firstly I bought &lt;a href="http://www.sjwatson-books.com/beforeigotosleep/about/" target="_blank">Before I Go to Sleep&lt;/a> by S. J. Watson - &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Memories define us. So what if you lost yours every time you went to sleep?&lt;/em> An original, haunting, and deeply chilling debut.&amp;rdquo; I enjoy reading books like this and this one sounds particularly interesting, the boyfriend fancies having a read of this after me too. Then I bought &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You&lt;/a> by Jojo Moyes - a girly book, don&amp;rsquo;t think the boyfriend will read this one :p. I wanted to also buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pink-Hotel-Anna-Stothard/dp/1846881315" target="_blank">The Pink Hotel&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Into-Darkest-Corner-Elizabeth-Haynes/dp/0956251579/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1332094500&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Into the Darkest Corner&lt;/a>, but they&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been up to this weekend? Enjoying the sun where you are?&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Today my &lt;a href="http://www.echoparkpaper.com/collections/for-the-record/" target="_blank">Echo Park - For The Record&lt;/a> collection kit came and I'm so excited to use it. I love the patterns and colours, and the cute little scrabble letters and the bird and flower stickers... I could go on. I got the kit for around £15 online and you get a lot for the money. The kit contains 12 sheets of 12x12 paper, alphas and border stickers, and element stickers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I just wish there was more time in the day to do scrapbooking, I get addicted to it once I start but I have uni work to catch up on first. The Wales v England 6 Nations rugby match is also on today so I shall be watching that, and I want to bake cupcakes today too.. better get started!!&lt;/p>

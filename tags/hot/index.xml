&lt;p>Bread 12/15: &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4683/pizza-margherita-in-4-easy-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pizza margherita&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I replaced the 300g bread flour stated in the recipe with 225g &amp;lsquo;00&amp;rsquo; flour and 75g finely ground semolina flour (thanks for the tip &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/recipe/pizza-dough" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jamie&lt;/a>!). I also left the dough to rise for an hour after kneading it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple years since I&amp;rsquo;ve made pizza from scratch, and although it&amp;rsquo;s not a typical &amp;lsquo;bread&amp;rsquo; I think the base counts! The pizza turned out really good, flavours were great and the only thing I think that would improve it is if I had a pizza stone and stretched the dough a little thinner.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never baked a treacle tart before. In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever baked any kind of tart. I received a &lt;a href="http://www.kitchencraft.co.uk/catalogue/detail.aspx?pid=17967&amp;amp;gid=41192&amp;amp;pg=5ulcAD71%2bPexhaYfvBsz%2fHT6rBVSpj1j" target="_blank">loose base fluted tin&lt;/a> for Christmas that I&amp;rsquo;d been wishing for, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to make any kind of tart, flan, or quiche since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which brings me to this week and my first attempt - Treacle Tart from Lorraine Pascal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943/ref=cm_cmu_pg_t" target="_blank">Baking Made Easy&lt;/a>. Treacle Tart is something me and Jon both really enjoy, it&amp;rsquo;s old-fashioned and super easy to make. It&amp;rsquo;s great straight from the oven with vanilla ice-cream, and I love how the top came out a little bit chewy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/treacletart2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1504" alt="treacletart2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/treacletart2.jpg" width="490" height="627" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>500 g sweet shortcrust pastry (I made mine from scratch or you can use shop-bought)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>450 g golden syrup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zest and juice of 1 lemon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>60 g butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tsp ground ginger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>250 g breadcrumbs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
[ordered_list style="decimal"]
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Get the oven on to 180°C. Roll out the pastry to about 3 mm thick and line the tart tin. Prick the base lightly with a fork and place in the fridge for around 20 mins to firm it up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the pastry case from the fridge. Take a piece of baking paper and cover the pastry. Fill it with baking beans or dried beans (I used lentils) and 'blind bake' in the oven for 15-20 mins. The edges should be lightly coloured and the base dry to the touch. Remove the beans and paper and return the pastry to the oven for 5 mins, until golden.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To make the filling, put the golden syrup, lemon zest and juice, butter and ground ginger into a large pan and melt gently over a low heat. Stir in the breadcrumbs, then pour the mixture into the pastry case and bake for 20-25 mins, until lightly browned and set.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
[/ordered_list]
&lt;p>Enjoy!&lt;/p>

And here&amp;rsquo;s what I ended up with&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/souffle.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906" title="souffle" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/souffle.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="734" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;chocolate soufflés!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4351/chocolate-souffls" target="_blank">this recipe&lt;/a> from BBC GoodFood, but used 1/3 of the ingredients to serve 2. I used &lt;a href="http://www.greenandblacks.com/uk/what-we-make/bars/cherry.html" target="_blank">Green &amp;amp; Black&amp;rsquo;s Cherry chocolate&lt;/a> (still leftover from Christmas!). The mixture filled both of my ramekins right to the top, and so I filled a silicone cupcake case up with the leftovers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After cooking for around 15mins, they were nice and firm on top but lovely and gooey in the middle! They tasted really good, and it was nice with the pieces of cherries from the chocolate. I think the ones in the ramekins were a bit too much, but the cupcake size was just right!&lt;/p>

Today is pancake day, so of course I had to make pancakes for breakfast :) Over the weekend I made the Martha Stewart pancakes which I wrote about &lt;a title="Valentine’s Baking and Craft Ideas" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/valentines-baking-and-craft-ideas/">here&lt;/a> and they were more American style and were &lt;em>really&lt;/em> good! I usually make the thin type and generally follow &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/basicpancakeswithsuga_66226">this&lt;/a> recipe, although I only use 1 egg, and I made these today as I think they're quicker to make than American style. Sadly we've run out of nutella but I still had a couple of strawberries with sugar. Although the bag of sugar does seem to have a hole in the bottom as my kitchen floor was covered in it afterwards, oops :/
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-215 aligncenter" title="IMGP2432" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2432-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/p>
I've been spending a bit of my birthday money online and am currently waiting for my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tala-Icing-Bag-Nozzles-Booklet/dp/B002U5C4ZC/ref=sr_1_2?s=kitchen&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1329864909&amp;amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">Tala Icing Bag Set in Tin&lt;/a> so I can start baking cupcakes as I've lost part of my old icing bag set, and this one looks so cute in the tin! I'm also expecting my &lt;a href="http://www.echoparkpaper.com/collections/for-the-record/" target="_blank">Echo Park For the Record&lt;/a> Paper Collection Kit to come soon, so I can continue scrapbooking, love the alphas and elements in this set. So hopefully they'll be here tomorrow!
&lt;p>I also just found out that last Thursday was apparently something called &lt;a href="http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/90408,Poles-gorge-themselves-on-Fat-Thursday" target="_blank">Fat Thursday&lt;/a>, gutted I missed out on that one. It&amp;rsquo;s a Polish tradition, an alternative to pancake day, where they basically eat a lot of doughnuts - I&amp;rsquo;ve marked it on my calender for next year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone celebrate Fat Thursday here? Seems like a good thing to celebrate :p&lt;/p>

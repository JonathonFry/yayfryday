&lt;p>After finishing my &lt;a title="Breaking Bad Cross Stitch" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/09/10/breaking-bad-cross-stitch/" target="_blank">Breaking Bad cross stitch&lt;/a>, I really wanted to make another one and since I had leftover supplies I dove straight in. (I actually finished this cross stitch during Summer over a couple of days - it&amp;rsquo;s taken me this long to get a hoop to frame it!). I was looking for something simple to sew and after searching pinterest decided on a curly ampersand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/11/ampersand-plan.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2023" alt="ampersand plan" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/11/ampersand-plan.jpg" width="490" height="580" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After drawing out the plan on grid paper I got sewing and couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop till it was finished! Very addictive. I really liked how it came out but was unsure how to frame it. Which brings me to this weekend when I finally decided to go and buy an 8&amp;quot; hoop. I painted it black for contrast (this was actually Jon&amp;rsquo;s idea!) and it can now be displayed, finally&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I start my new full-time job next Tuesday, and whilst I&amp;rsquo;m not working I&amp;rsquo;ve been filling my weekdays with baking, crafting and housework. And watching back to back episodes of Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy (addicted). Last week I decided to give cross stitching a go. It&amp;rsquo;s cheap and time-consuming and I can watch as much TV as possible whilst doing it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t cross stitched since I was 15 but it&amp;rsquo;s super simple to pick up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a browse on Etsy and decided to purchase this &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/125818162/breaking-bad-cross-stitch-pattern" target="_blank">Breaking Bad cross stitch&lt;/a> pattern. Breaking Bad is an awesome TV show from beginning to end (OK we are a couple episodes from the end but we know it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be crazy good) so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be cool to remember it with this cross stitch. Jon gave it a thumbs up too which sealed the deal. I bought all the supplies online and got started on it as soon as it was all delivered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed making it and I&amp;rsquo;ve already begun my next cross stitch project. Think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a new hobby here..&lt;/p>

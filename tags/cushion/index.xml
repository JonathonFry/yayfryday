&lt;p>This was a cushion cover DIY that I made before dinner this evening. Super quick and easy. I had found a couple plain white linen covers that I bought off eBay a while ago and decided to jazz one up a bit with a geometric pattern. It&amp;rsquo;s got hexagons, triangles, circles, squares and probably some more shapes thrown in!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcushionsteps.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1919" alt="bwcushionsteps" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcushionsteps.jpg" width="490" height="550" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I drew out the lines first using a pencil and ruler starting with a cross through the middle. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any measurements and just went with it. The good thing with cushion covers is they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be perfect because when they are filled they&amp;rsquo;ll be all bendy anway and you won&amp;rsquo;t see if the lines are a bit off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used my &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sharpie-Rub-a-Dub%C3%82%C2%AE-Laundry-Marker-Black/dp/B00387BTJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1333231606&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Sharpie Laundry Marker&lt;/a> to draw over the lines (and placed cardboard inside the cover so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t transfer to the back), and then drew on the circles using buttons as stencils.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcusion1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1922" alt="bwcushion1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/bwcusion1.jpg" width="490" height="1128" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It reminds me a bit of those ball and stick models from chemistry classes. I like how the pattern came out, and for just a half hour DIY it&amp;rsquo;s great!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A little while ago I stumbled upon the blog &lt;a href="http://witandwhistle.com/2012/01/16/diy-stencil-pillow/" target="_blank">Wit &amp;amp; Whistle&lt;/a> when I was looking for crafty ideas. I love cushions and was looking for a way I could customise one myself, and fell in love with this one, such a great idea! I had to make it as luckily the instructions sounded pretty straightforward. Click the link above for the detailed instructions, they&amp;rsquo;re really good!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only problem I had was deciding on what to actually put on the cushion. I wanted quite a long quote that would cover the entire cover, and there were so many I wanted. But I finally decided on &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/22842" target="_blank">this quote&lt;/a> - gotta love Dr Seuss! The supplies I used were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Plain Cushion Cover (Bought mine from H&amp;amp;M &lt;a href="http://www.hm.com/gb/product/83390?article=83390-E#article=83390-A" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Fabric Marker (Purchased from Amazon &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sharpie-Rub-a-Dub%C3%82%C2%AE-Laundry-Marker-Black/dp/B00387BTJS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1333231606&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Stencil (Again from Amazon &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Helix-Lettering-Stencil-10mm-H40891/dp/B00290IYS4/ref=sr_1_2?s=officeproduct&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1333231651&amp;amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">here&lt;/a> - I used the 30mm one)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A pencil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some cardboard (for placing inside cover)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/diy-cushion.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-498" title="diy cushion" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/diy-cushion.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1189" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>Then I did a couple of calculations and measurements to work out how many lines to do and words/letters per line. I used tape to make a straight line each time I did a row so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get all wonky. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth using a pencil with the stencil before the pen to make sure the words all fit in, remember the pen is permanent! Then it&amp;rsquo;s just simply using the fabric marker to stencil in the letters and fill them in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2690.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-500" title="IMGP2690" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/04/IMGP2690.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="405" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s done :) It did take me quite a while to do but that&amp;rsquo;s because I do usually take a while over things like this, but I enjoy doing it! Really pleased with how it came out - these cushions would make great gifts too!&lt;/p>

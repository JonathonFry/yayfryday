&lt;p>Bread 14/15: &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/english_muffins_56640" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>English Muffins&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: Stuck to the recipe. The dough was really wet which made it quite hard to knead. They were &amp;lsquo;baked&amp;rsquo; in a frying pan on the hob.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: I eat english muffins quite a lot for breakfast (straight from the freezer to the toaster) so I thought they&amp;rsquo;d be a good choice, plus they&amp;rsquo;re a bit different since they aren&amp;rsquo;t baked in the oven. They taste good and Jon and I ate them for our weekday breakfasts with nutella or toasted with butter. The texture was slightly different to the shop bought muffins, they were more airy which I think was because of the wet dough.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: Followed the recipe. The ingredients list states 140ml olive oil but the recipe only mentions 40ml, so I used 40ml where it stated and didn&amp;rsquo;t measure any more out just drizzled lots on top before and after baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Yet again a recipe from Paul Hollywood and yet again it is excellent! Seriously, this is one of my favourites so far. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to turn this in to a sandwich for lunch tomorrow (if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t all been eaten by then).&lt;/p>

>Pizza margherita&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I replaced the 300g bread flour stated in the recipe with 225g &amp;lsquo;00&amp;rsquo; flour and 75g finely ground semolina flour (thanks for the tip &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/recipe/pizza-dough" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jamie&lt;/a>!). I also left the dough to rise for an hour after kneading it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple years since I&amp;rsquo;ve made pizza from scratch, and although it&amp;rsquo;s not a typical &amp;lsquo;bread&amp;rsquo; I think the base counts! The pizza turned out really good, flavours were great and the only thing I think that would improve it is if I had a pizza stone and stretched the dough a little thinner.&lt;/p>

>How to Bake&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I kept to the recipe exactly. All of the breads I&amp;rsquo;ve baked from this book have come out fantastically! And if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the book I&amp;rsquo;m sure this recipe is out there on Google.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: The dough is very similar to the &lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/08/28/baking-bread-ciabatta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ciabatta&lt;/a> one, which I loved and have baked multiple times since. This bread came out just as tasty but with the added wow from the mozzarella, tomatoes and oregano. Seriously good and very difficult to not eat it all at once!&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I was a bit scared of making bagels, with the boiling stage and shaping them I thought something would probably go wrong along the way. I kept to the recipe since it had so many good reviews, and the only part I had trouble with was getting the round shape right. But they&amp;rsquo;re almost there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: so chewy, &lt;em>so good&lt;/em>. I can see sweet cinnamon and raisin bagels being made with this recipe.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: Followed the recipe exactly. I used a hand whisk with dough hook attachments as Paul advises against using your hands because the dough is so sticky.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Light and soft with a crisp crust - lovely. Great toasted, spreaded with hummus and topped with sausages for breakfast! Will definitely be baking more of these.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I made 12 breadsticks as stated in the recipe, each 25cm long. I shaped half of them into twists and used chilli salt, black pepper, poppy seeds and sea salt as toppings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: They&amp;rsquo;re great for dipping, but I found them quite chewy on their own. I also would have preferred them to be thinner, perhaps by dividing the dough into more sticks or making extra long ones. The chilli salt ones were my favourite.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: So I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to bake 15 loaves by 2013 but I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue on anyway! I halved the recipe to make one loaf and added poppy seeds on top, everything else I kept to the recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: One of my favourites so far. It only needs 15mins to rise in a warm place, and then goes straight in the oven (not preheated) with a tray of water underneath, simple. Oh and it tastes delicious too!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: OK, so I was supposed to do the eight-strand loaf as in the recipe, but I tried and failed&amp;hellip; my kitchen is too small I couldn&amp;rsquo;t spread the 8 strands out wide enough and I just went for a simple 3 strand loaf in the end. One day I will do it, but for now this is good enough for me :p&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Yummy and soft. Think it could do with a bit more salt, I&amp;rsquo;ve just run out so there&amp;rsquo;s only a teeny bit in it. We ate around half the loaf with leftover sausage casserole for lunch, and tomorrow we&amp;rsquo;ll have some with soup! So good with this cold weather.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: Followed the recipe exactly, although I found the dough to be quite sticky so added a touch more flour when I was kneading to stop it from sticking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Lovely and soft, although I think I&amp;rsquo;d use less sugar next time as they were a bit sweet for me. Tomorrow we are having soup and these will go down nicely!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: This is a quick bread and not a yeast one. I added 1/2 tsp of paprika and used mature cheddar, and finally got some use out of my chives! I also sprinkled some of the cheddar on top of the dough before baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Loved how quick it was to make with no waiting around to rise. The smell coming from the oven was so good it was hard to wait for the bread to cool, and it sure does taste as good as it smells. Great flavour and texture.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bread 3/15 : olive oil bread from &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1162642/" target="_blank">BBC GoodFood&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I added a handful of chopped green olives to the dough on top of the 2tbsp olive oil. As others have also commented on the recipe, the bread did go brown quite quickly so I covered with foil and turned down the heat to 210C halfway through. As well as a serrated knife I also need a really sharp knife or a razor blade to score the loaf properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Great flavour, could easily make this one again. That&amp;rsquo;s our sandwich bread sorted for the next couple days!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: I liked that it used a &amp;lsquo;squidge&amp;rsquo; of honey rather than any sugar. After 10mins the loaf had already coloured as much as I wanted it to go so I covered the top with foil to stop it going any darker. For my first loaf it was nice and easy, although I really need to get a serrated knife!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Lovely soft bread that tastes as good as a plain white loaf can. Great with butter or nutella, &lt;em>especially when it&amp;rsquo;s still warm&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>{ I chose this bread as my first loaf for its simplicity. I figured if there&amp;rsquo;s no disasters with this then I can go ahead with my plan to bake 15 different breads by 2013. So here goes!}&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

Relaxing in front of a cosy fire, trips to a local pub and frosty walks were just what I was looking for and I knew a return to Loch Tay would be a perfect place for that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon &amp;amp; I booked a stay at a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1866736" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>converted mill&lt;/a>, a gorgeous airbnb that the listing didn&amp;rsquo;t do justice. We felt very lucky to stay in such a wonderful place with views overlooking the loch.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We arrived at Loch Tay about an hour before sun set, after a lovely drive from Edinburgh through the Trossachs. Since it was such a nice day we decided to detour last minute up the road toward Ben Lawers. We parked the car before the road got too icy and made it on foot to reach the Ben Lawers Dam. It was very cold and windy, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t take too long before we were on our way back to warm up in the car. The sun was setting and the sky was turning pink. Plenty of sheep on the road made us take a slow journey down the mountain and it gave us plenty of time to take in the sunset.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By the time we reached the bottom it had turned dark and the search for the mill where we were spending the night began. After plenty of back and forths we found the house and after exploring all the rooms and being surprised at how much bigger it was than the photos, we lit the fire and pulled the blankets out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The sun was out again on Saturday which meant after breakfast I soon had itchy feet and wanted to go out to explore. We drove out along the loch and round to the crannog centre for some great views. The short walk up to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/perthshire/falls-of-acharn.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Falls of Acharn&lt;/a> was lovely and the waterfalls were flowing fast. For lunch we stopped off at the Habitat Cafe in Aberfeldy for some delicious soup and hot drinks, just what I needed after a cold walk. We carried on back towards the mill, making a stop at Castle Menzies and another short walk through &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/perthshire/weem-wood.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Weem Wood to St David’s Well&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By the time we were back in the car the Wales v England rugby had started, so we hurried back to drop the car off and then walked along the road to the pub at the Ben Lawers Hotel. They were playing the rugby in a small room which looked like it was someone’s living room with three big sofas. We were later joined by a family from Newcastle, but thankfully a couple of them were also Welsh supporters! After some drinks and a defeat, we walked back to the mill for another night sat in front of the fire.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My birthday began with strawberry pancakes and Jon walking in with a birthday cake lit with matchsticks (after forgetting the candles!). We spent some time on the balcony watching the clouds lift and the sun peak out over the mountains. Soon we were back on the road in the direction of Edinburgh, but we were lucky again with the weather so had to make a stop to squeeze in another walk before we went back. We walked the Kiltyrie Hidden History Trail which was a great loop, but it was quite open and the wind was very cold so we had to keep moving. We made sure to climb on to a boulder for some jump photos though. Back in the car for the rest of the journey home after another lovely trip to Loch Tay!&lt;/p>

On Friday I heard that the cherry blossom had arrived in the Meadows so I made plans to take a walk to the park on Saturday with camera in hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We walked to the Meadows via Bruntsfield, with a scrummy stop off at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cafegrande.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cafe Grande&lt;/a> for a late breakfast. I had a bacon breakfast roll and Jon went for poached eggs on toast, gobbled down with a cup of tea and a cappuccino.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I recommend a trip to the Meadows for plenty of cherry blossom photo opportunities. Just get there early if it&amp;rsquo;s a sunny day - before the barbecuers descend (or you could join them).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Spring!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weekend was Jon&amp;rsquo;s birthday weekend (hooray!) and we spent our Saturday in East Lothian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started the day at Seacliff beach (they normally have a barrier charging £2 per car for parking but it was broken). The drive from Edinburgh was lovely, passing through fields of rapeseed, and the sandy beach at Seacliff was nice and quiet. There are great views of Bass Rock and Tantallon castle here, somehow this was our first visit (and will not be our last). We went for a walk along the rocks, past the teeny harbour, towards the castle.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Late afternoon we drove to North Berwick. I had pre-bought tickets for the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.seabird.org/boats/three-islands-seabird-seafari/14/159" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Three Islands Seabird Seafari&lt;/a> RIB trip and the weather was perfect for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The highlight for me was the puffins on Craigleith Island. The volume of gannets on Bass Rock was amazing too, and it was a good idea to put the hood from the waterproofs up as there were a lot of birds flying above us! It was so much fun, we want to do the Isle of May trip next.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The alarm went off on Sunday and we jumped to the end of the bed to open the blinds. It was still pretty dark outside but as our eyes adjusted we could make out a white triangle - the Matterhorn!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We packed our bags and headed for the train station lockers. It was amazing to see the mountains that were surrounding the town, it felt so different to the day before. Since the weather was so nice we decided we would take the Gornergrat train up to the top of the mountain. It was so worth it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was -17C at the top but the sun definitely helped. We hiked down from &lt;strong>Rotenboden &amp;gt; Riffelberg&lt;/strong>. This was an interesting hike as it turned out we were on a snowshoe trail (the walking trail was hidden under the snow). We came across another walker who was as confused about the trail as we were and it seemed we were way off track. We were trying to find the Riffelsee lake (which we later discovered was just buried under the snow). It was a fantastic walk regardless (although I did step thigh deep in snow twice, Jon had to help me out!).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At Riffelberg we sat in the sun with a drink and a toblerone (we couldn&amp;rsquo;t help ourselves!), before taking the train back down to Zermatt and catching the train on to Visp and onwards to Basel. (We stocked up on chocolate &amp;amp; fondue before we left too)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few weeks ago Jon &amp;amp; I took a 2-night trip to Zermatt. It was our first trip to Switzerland together and it was beautiful. We flew cheap with Easyjet to Basel and travelled down to Zermatt by train using Swiss transfer tickets. We stayed in a lovely &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/869728" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>airbnb studio apartment&lt;/a> on the river with views of the Matterhorn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two days (Friday &amp;amp; Saturday) were foggy and snowy &amp;amp; visiblity was very poor. On Friday evening we explored the car free village and cooked rösti with gruyere, finished off with swiss chocolate (of course ;)).&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We layered up for a full day out hiking, and checked which trails were open. We decided on the loop &lt;strong>Zermatt &amp;gt; Z&amp;rsquo;mutt &amp;gt; Furi &amp;gt; Zum See &amp;gt; Zermatt&lt;/strong> for our first hike with a lunch stop at &lt;a class="link" href="http://chalet-altesse-restaurant-zumsee.ch/en/restaurant-zumsee-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Restaurant Zum See&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hike was a little tiring in parts (especially when the snow was blowing in our faces) but it was good to breathe in the fresh mountain air and do some exploring. A friendly ginger cat lead us from Z&amp;rsquo;mutt almost to Furi (we actually had to run away from it so it would stop walking with us&amp;hellip;). If we stopped walking it would start meowing at us to hurry up! Lunch at Zum See was amazing, I ate croute au fromage with bacon and tomatoes (sooo good) and Jon had rösti with bacon and eggs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the afternoon we hiked &lt;strong>Zermatt &amp;gt; Findeln &amp;gt; Zermatt&lt;/strong>. There were a lot of switchbacks and we had to dodge the tobogganers coming down the trail. It was a lovely walk and we made it back down just before sunset.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last weekend Jon &amp;amp; I went up north to Loch Tay with 2 of our friends and their black labrador pup. This was our second time staying in Loch Tay (we stayed in a beautiful cottage there for our anniversary last year), it&amp;rsquo;s a lovely location with lots to do in the area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stayed in a 2 bedroom cottage (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/3825964" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this one&lt;/a>) which had views over the lake, it&amp;rsquo;s own private beach and a games room with a table tennis table. We played board games, sat by the fire, cooked in the fantastic kitchen and went walking by the lake and up in to the mountains. There was no TV and I had no phone signal, so it was a complete retreat away from screens and it felt so good.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of August Jon and I went on a trip up north to Glencoe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neither of us had visited Glencoe before. On the drive up I read a bit about the history (the massacre of Glencoe) and we planned what we were going to do. We had picked out a walk the day before (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/buachailleetivebeag.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Buachaille Etive Beag&lt;/a>) that would cover two munros.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The drive in to Glencoe was fantastic. We arrived at the tiny campsite and quickly pitched our tent. There was a crazy amount of midges, and so there was a lot of running around and flapping about. As soon as the tent was up we ran for the car and headed straight to Glencoe village for some midge repellent. I counted 21 midge bites on my face alone&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Sep/3IMG_1958-copy.jpg"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we were quite tired after the terror of the midges, we decided we&amp;rsquo;d go for a drive down the Glen Etive minor road to Loch Etive. It was a lovely drive (this road featured in Skyfall) and we stopped off along the way to enjoy the views. We ate lunch at Loch Etive and we didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter any more midges.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After arriving back at our tent after eating dinner we settled in for the night. We then realised that we had left our bag full of our clothes and toiletries back at our flat!! So we had no walking clothes with us&amp;hellip; so no munros were to be bagged the next day :( I think it must&amp;rsquo;ve been really early when we fell asleep as we were both wide awake at 6am ready to start the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://yayfrydayy.com/images/2014/Sep/3IMG_1961.JPG"
loading="lazy"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We packed up the tent and headed straight to the car park by the three sisters. We hiked up to the lost valley which was really fun and quite a scramble! We spotted an eagle circling up high too. It was a great walk and we were the only people there. We were back at the car by 10:30 and on the road to Edinburgh shortly after.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are 282 Munros in Scotland and this is our second (&lt;a class="link" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/08/29/ben-lomond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ben Lomond&lt;/a> was our first). Ben Vorlich is 985m (3,232ft) high. We parked the car at Loch Earn and followed the trail in almost a straight line up to the top. It was a fairly steady climb, although the final climb is pretty rocky and steep. I was very slow at going down this part!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was very chilly at the top, which was refreshing after how hot I had felt on the way up.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a great week of weather the weekend comes along and brings with it the rain. At least we had to spend most of the day waiting in on an IKEA delivery and then 3 hours building a sofabed. At around 8pm we decided it was time to leave the flat despite the downpour. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like summer with this weather but I am so enjoying these long daylight hours.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday Jon &amp;amp; I, along with our friends Nat &amp;amp; Mike, set off to Loch Lomond for some hill walking. We parked up at Rowardennan to tackle Ben Lomond. The &amp;lsquo;Munro&amp;rsquo; is 974 m (3196 ft) high, making it the highest mountain we&amp;rsquo;ve walked up together. We were prepared for rain as always, but instead the sun was out the whole time and I ended up coming home with sunburnt arms&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went up via the &amp;rsquo;tourist route&amp;rsquo; and ended up going back down the same way (around 12km). We were so low on water and with the sun out we wanted to get back as soon as possible. Next time, for sure, we will take the CamelBak out with us. It was a pretty tough walk in parts during the ascent, but the way back down was so much better we were all pretty much running down it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/benlomond1.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1942" alt="benlomond1" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/benlomond1.jpg" width="490" height="1794" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the top we could see Ben Nevis in the distance. This was a fantastic walk and great practice for us.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday, Jon &amp;amp; I headed out for the Pentland hills for some hill walking. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been hill walking in a while, and since we are planning on walking up Ben Nevis by next Summer we thought we should get back into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We parked up at Flotterstone and did the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks Short Route&lt;/a>, a nice 10km/3hrs 30mins loop. I always try and print out the planned route before we go - Bing maps have an Ordnance Survey layer which is great and of course free!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1937" alt="pentlands2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/08/pentlands2.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t so great - one minute the sun was shining and the next it was pouring down. It was also super windy on the hills. I was almost blown away! The views were fantastic and we shall have to come back to do the 18km route in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I finally have my first ever pair of hiking boots, yay! No more walking up hills in my Hunter Wellies and having sore toes and heels, although they were great at keeping the mud off me. After lots of searching online I went to McArthurGlen in Livingston and tried on a few pairs of boots I&amp;rsquo;d read good things about. In the end I chose these &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/womens/viper-womens-boot-p5978.aspx" target="_blank">Viper Women&amp;rsquo;s Waterproof Hiking Boots&lt;/a> from Mountain Warehouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me they are super comfortable, the grip is great, and they are leather too which is something I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1891" alt="boots" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/boots.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Sunday we went for a walk to Cramond Island, which is a tidal island, to test out my boots. Jon wore  boots which were left in our flat by a previous tenant! I don&amp;rsquo;t think his boots are waterproof though, so he has been looking for new ones and saw they actually do a &lt;a href="http://www.mountainwarehouse.com/footwear/hiking-boots/mens/viper-waterproof-boot-p7481.aspx?ism=0&amp;amp;cl=BROWN" target="_blank">men&amp;rsquo;s version&lt;/a> of mine!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily the tide was out so we were able to walk across the causeway. It was seriously windy and we could barely hear each other speak. It was a lovely walk with great views of Edinburgh and the Forth Road Bridge. We walked back along the wet beach, at one point I almost got stuck and luckily my boots were tied tight or they might have come off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1892" alt="cramond" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/cramond.jpg" width="490" height="1834" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to going for bigger walks in the future and giving these a proper test.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Thursday Jon and I drove down to the Lake District. We decided to break the journey from Edinburgh to Cardiff by staying overnight at Grasmere, and on Friday continuing on to Alton Towers and arriving in Cardiff in the evening. It was a 3hr drive to Grasmere and driving through the Lake District was gorgeous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We booked the &lt;a href="http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/grasmere-butharlyp-howe" target="_blank">Youth Hostel&lt;/a> on Monday, and the only one which had private rooms still available was the one in Grasmere. Grasmere is known as the place William Wordsworth lived, and apparently he described it as &amp;ldquo;the loveliest spot that man hath ever found&amp;rdquo;. The youth hostel was in this lovely converted Victorian mansion:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/YHA-grasmere.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1775" alt="YHA grasmere" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/YHA-grasmere.jpg" width="490" height="731" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a great, cheap place to stay. We spotted 3 deer just outside the hostel and lots of rabbits running about. We went for a walk, and having done some research before heading out we decided upon the &lt;a href="http://where2walk.co.uk/lake_district/lake_discoveries/easedale-tarn-from-grasmere/" target="_blank">walk to Easedale Tarn&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1778" alt="easedale" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale.jpg" width="490" height="1439" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a nice and easy walk, although it rained the whole time. I took a few too many photos of lambs along the first quarter of the route (they were so cute!), but as my legs started to get rather wet we sped up the hill along the waterfalls. The views were fantastic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We reached Easedale Tarn, and there were just a few people about so it was nice and quiet. Wish we had waterproof trousers though! On the way back towards Grasmere the ground was very wet and muddy. There were stepping stones almost the whole way which helped a lot (luckily I had wellies on so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad), but some parts it seemed we were walking in a stream!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale-tarn.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1777" alt="easedale tarn" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/easedale-tarn.jpg" width="490" height="1270" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time we got back to the youth hostel we were soaked through and we turned the heating up to full to start drying out our shoes and all of our clothes. Jon had a nap for an hour whilst I read a book, and before we knew it it was dinner time! Which meant we had missed having a look around the village shops. I really wanted to go to the &lt;a href="http://www.grasmeregingerbread.co.uk/" target="_blank">Grasmere Gingerbread Shop&lt;/a>, but a look from the outside had to do instead&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/grasmere-gingerbread.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1773" alt="grasmere gingerbread" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/grasmere-gingerbread.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ate at a pub in Grasmere called The Lamb Inn which was yummy, and finished it off with apple crumble and ice-cream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day we woke up early and headed down to Alton Towers. We were there from 10-5 and luckily it stayed dry the whole time. It was super quiet too, with the longest queue being 15mins. So fun!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/altontowers.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1776" alt="altontowers" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/altontowers.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Saturday Jon and I went for a walk in the Pentland hills with our friends Natalie and Mike. The sun came out and it was almost 10°C so we had to make the most of it! We parked near the ski centre and walked up the steep hill, following the Capital View trail. It was really slippery with ice and mud in places and so we slipped a lot on the way down (Natalie in particular) and once you started sliding it was hard to stop!! We are all planning to invest in walking boots in the future :D&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Oh and my legs are still aching&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d make the run today but managed it (just about)!&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;em>Walking around Holyrood Park&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no snow in Edinburgh but it sure is cold here. Next week is looking to be colder, I really want to invest in an electric blanket! Hope you have a lovely weekend :)&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s now a month till exams and it&amp;rsquo;s starting to really sink in that by April uni will be over, forever. So I&amp;rsquo;m making sure I make the most of it and come out with a good degree, which means most of my time is taken up with studying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I try to keep one weekend day mostly free of work, and today is one of those days :) This morning Jon and I went to the cinema to see a screening of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/" target="_blank">Argo&lt;/a> which was really good (and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it), followed by some food shopping and some online catch-up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a few things I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/cows.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1351" title="cows" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/cows.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="656" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went for a walk in the Pentlands with some friends when the sun came out. It was so muddy and we went the steepest possible way up the hill. The way down was particularly funny when everyone slipped in the mud except for me ha! But we do really need to invest in some walking boots :p We also stumbled across this gathering of highland cattle which completely blocked our path, so we patiently waited for them to move as we were too scared to get close!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/rolocookies.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1352" title="rolocookies" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/rolocookies.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I baked &lt;a title="Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/" target="_blank">cookies&lt;/a>, rolo ones, that lasted 2 days at most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/halloween.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1353" title="halloween" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/halloween.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to a Halloween party as a skeleton! The pic on the left was taken a couple of days before the party when I did a trial run of the make-up so it&amp;rsquo;s a bit rough. Was a great party and I only spent £2 on my &amp;lsquo;costume&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/sparklers.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1354" title="sparklers" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/11/sparklers.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="150" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally today I picked up some &lt;a href="http://www.tesco.com/free-sparklers/free-sparklers.pdf" target="_blank">free sparklers&lt;/a> from Tesco (click the link to get the coupon), a few of us plan on going up Blackford Hill to watch some fireworks tomorrow night, can&amp;rsquo;t wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, I&amp;rsquo;m going to put on the kettle for a hot chocolate and try to apply for some jobs. Have a nice Sunday!&lt;/p>

Sorry it&amp;rsquo;s been a while, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing much worth sharing since I&amp;rsquo;ve been back in uni and settling in. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched my degree course from Maths with Finance to just Maths which I am so much happier with, and am now back in the swing of things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s some pics Jon took on his phone - the Samsung Galaxy S2 - of things we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently (minus the cookie pics which came from my camera). I think some of them came out pretty well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/dianai.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1253" title="diana&amp;amp;i" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/dianai.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="735" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Taking photos with my Diana F+&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/bigcookie.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1256" title="bigcookie" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/bigcookie.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="183" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Baking lots of chewy cookies (recipe &lt;a title="Chewy ‘Millie’s Cookie Style’ Cookies" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chewy-millies-cookie-style-cookies/">here&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/George-Heriot-School.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1257" title="Camera 360" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/George-Heriot-School.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="799" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Visiting &lt;a href="http://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/george-heriots-trust-historic-building-p245351" target="_blank">George Heriot's School&lt;/a> as part of Edinburgh's &lt;a title="European Heritage Days" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/european-heritage-days/" target="_blank">Open Door Days&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/corstophinehill1.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260" title="corstophinehill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/corstophinehill1.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">Walking around the wooded Corstophine Hill and up the &lt;a href="http://www.corstorphinehill.org.uk/thetower.htm" target="_blank">tower&lt;/a> (which was open as another part of the Open Door Days).&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">When we turned around from that viewpoint above this is what we saw...&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/zebra.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261" title="zebra" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/zebra.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="629" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">..Zebras! Through a large fence is Edinburgh Zoo, which backs on to a path around the hill. We could hear kids shouting from inside the zoo and that's when we noticed that the zebras were right up by the fence near us! Gotta love seeing a herd of zebras whilst walking through the woods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Hope you're having a lovely weekend!&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s our first &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; walk in the Hills and we both really enjoyed it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_1214&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;490&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1214" title="allermuir hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/capitalviewwalk.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="326" />&lt;/a> Allermuir Hill (493m)[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got the ski lift going part of the way up which saved our legs a bit of work. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to ride on it before and seeing as &lt;a title="European Heritage Days" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/european-heritage-days/" target="_blank">it was free&lt;/a> it had to be done. Great views at the top of the slopes too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/cvw.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1215" title="capital view walk" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/cvw.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1752" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How cute are those thatched cottages?! The walk passes through the lovely Swanston village, where apparently Robert Louis Stevenson spent his summer days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took us a little over 2 hours to complete the loop, and our legs were aching by the end of it. There were a few steep parts that got our heart pumping. We need to do this more often and would love to do the &lt;a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/see-do/activities/walking/pentland-peaks" target="_blank">Pentland Peaks&lt;/a> walk in the future!&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Walked&lt;/em> in the Pentland Hills in the rain.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Shopped&lt;/em> in TK Maxx. Jon picked up an outdoorsy coat and I found some glass cups (we only had one left) which we managed to get the price down to 50p per cup!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Watched&lt;/em> 2 free movies at the cinema. Hope Springs and Untouchable - I recommend both, &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/" target="_blank">Untouchable&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Explored&lt;/em> a part of Edinburgh we hadn't been to before. More on that below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Enjoyed&lt;/em> our last week before University begins.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div>[hr]&lt;/div>
The part of Edinburgh we went to was a bit of a spur of the moment thingy. After driving back from TK Maxx, I spotted a sign for the &lt;a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/vc/index.html" target="_blank">Royal Observatory&lt;/a> and thought we should check it out. We drove past the lovely shops in Morningside and through Blackford, past some gorgeous (and huge) houses that we dreamed of living in, and finally up the steep hill to the Observatory.
&lt;p>We parked up and it seemed like we weren&amp;rsquo;t in the city anymore. We were on &lt;a href="http://www.fohb.org/new/index.htm" target="_blank">Blackford Hill&lt;/a> which is a local nature reserve  with fields of grass, crags, a lake and river. So we decided to walk up to the top of hill.  It was such a windy day and at the top I struggled to stand straight! The views from the top were the best I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Edinburgh (a 360° panorama). It was also really quiet, just a few dog walkers and that was it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These photos were taken on my phone so they&amp;rsquo;re pretty bad quality. [Jon&amp;rsquo;s just renewed his phone contract and now has a Samsung Galaxy S2 (woo!) so I can use the camera on that when I don&amp;rsquo;t have my proper camera with me now :D]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1195" title="blackford hill" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/09/blackford-hill.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1063" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love finding new places like this. This would be an awesome place to come and watch fireworks or for a picnic in the sun. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised it&amp;rsquo;s not so well known!&lt;/p>

The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good but we wanted to get some fresh air and exercise after a very lazy weekend (think movies and lots of ice-cream). From our flat to the park it&amp;rsquo;s about 2.5miles through Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s old town. We had planned on walking up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat but the ground was quite slippery so skipped it this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988" title="holyrood" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="1062" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead we walked along the Salisbury Crags and up to the base of Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat and around in a loop. There were quite a lot of people about, and a few runners covered in mud. We would like to live near here so we could go jogging around the park in the mornings, perhaps one day we will try and jog there and back from our flat (hmm just maybe).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh, it&amp;rsquo;s nice having such a big park so close to the city centre and with great views of the city. There&amp;rsquo;s lots of walks to do in the park, and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it to anyone visiting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989" title="holyrood2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/holyrood2.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="343" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully the weather will pick up soon, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe we are already in July.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rainy Days</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/rainy-days/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2012 15:24:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/rainy-days/</guid><description>&lt;p>The weather hasn&amp;rsquo;t been too great recently. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel like yesterday was the beginning of summer. I&amp;rsquo;m not enjoying spending so much time in the flat, especially as I made some calculations and figured we couldn&amp;rsquo;t spend any money until the end of July (next payday) for us to afford rent over summer. So we shall have to start making money other ways and doing as much free stuff to keep us entertained!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we went to Union Canal in Fountainbridge with some leftover crusts of bread. We were soaked by the time we returned home but it feels good once in a while to get out in the rain and not care about being wet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887" title="feedducks" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/06/feedducks.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="531" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny moment when Jon threw some bread, we heard a thump and a pigeon fly right across us, he accidentally hit the poor thing! We felt like kids feeding the ducks, and think we shall go and feed them each time we have old stale bread instead of throwing it in the bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been doing with all these rainy days?&lt;/p>

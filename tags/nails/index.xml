I had a fantastic one :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, as I share my birthday with 2 friends (they&amp;rsquo;re twins!), we all went out in Edinburgh to celebrate. I bought a new dress with my birthday cash from ASOS, this one to be precise:&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/bdaydress.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1524" alt="bdaydress" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/bdaydress.jpg" width="490" height="625" />&lt;/a>

which I loved :) Of course, I painted my nails too in my new &lt;a title="Nails in Coralicious" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/03/02/nails-in-coralicious/">Coralicious polish&lt;/a>, love the bright colour against the black and white print.

&lt;p>During the day Jon took me for &lt;a title="Lunch at Papii" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/02/12/lunch-at-papii/" target="_blank">lunch at Papii&lt;/a>, I popped in to uni for a couple of classes then returned home for a chinese takeaway. I also received lots of cool gifts, here&amp;rsquo;s a couple I just had to share (excuse the lack of lighting!)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/travelbook.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1535" alt="travelbook" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/travelbook.jpg" width="490" height="903" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. The Travel Book: A Journey Through Every Country in the World.&lt;/strong> Where to go next&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;d love to travel around South America, especially Peru!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Gok Cooks Chinese.&lt;/strong> Jon and I cooked the Soy Glazed Chicken for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day and it was divine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s my 23rd birthday!&lt;/p>

So to accompany the sunshine I&amp;rsquo;ve painted my nails in a bright new nail varnish that I bought for my birthday. It&amp;rsquo;s Rimmel 60 Second nail polish in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rimmel-Nail-Polish-Second-Coralicious/dp/B0046U82I2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top" target="_blank">Coralicious&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/coralicious.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1529" alt="coralicious" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/coralicious.jpg" width="490" height="657" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love this colour! It&amp;rsquo;s so bright and fresh, and makes me smile each time the colour catches my eye. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried Rimmel nail varnish before, and I must say I&amp;rsquo;m impressed. The brush is so wide which makes application super easy and quick. And it dries within the 60 seconds as advertised. It&amp;rsquo;s fine with just one coat, but if you want it extra bright I&amp;rsquo;d go for 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can see this bottle will be getting lots of use over summer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>NB. I picked mine up from ASDA for £3.68.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nails in Pool Party</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/nails-in-pool-party/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2012 16:28:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/nails-in-pool-party/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/poolparty.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024" title="poolparty" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/poolparty.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="707" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;del>started to spend&lt;/del> spent all of the £100 that I won from Uni which I mentioned &lt;a title="Taste of Edinburgh Cancelled…" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/taste-of-edinburgh-cancelled/">here&lt;/a>. Something that I wanted to buy was a new nail varnish and I decided on &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag=&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=2412181&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId=&amp;amp;searchTerm=Pool&amp;amp;pageSize=20" target="_blank">this one&lt;/a> from Topshop in Pool Party. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely, bright and glossy turquoisey blue - great for summer! I only own pinks, reds and neutral nail polishes so it was good to get something totally different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I only put it on today so I can&amp;rsquo;t comment on how long it&amp;rsquo;ll last, although at work my nails chip &lt;em>a lot &lt;/em>so I&amp;rsquo;m not expecting too much, but it was nice and thick and feels good quality. In the photo I only have one coat on and no top coat so it&amp;rsquo;s not completely opaque. It&amp;rsquo;s my first Topshop nail varnish and I already want more, they have so many good colours! It cost £5 but as a student with 10% off it came down to £4.50 ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along with my new nail polish I bought lots of clothes. I rarely buy clothes, usually just after Christmas and my birthday, but when I do I tend to buy them all in one go.  I&amp;rsquo;m definitely more of a saver than a spender. I may post about what I bought tomorrow :D&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A couple of days ago I had a bit of time spare so painted my nails. I used Max Factor&amp;rsquo;s nailfinity in Red Passion that I had for my bday. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely vibrant red. I used the nail art pen again that I used &lt;a title="Chevron Nail Art" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/chevron-nail-art/">here&lt;/a>, and painted on some dots. The pen&amp;rsquo;s great for doing polka dots, just make sure to put a clear coat of varnish on top or they might chip off. I think they look kinda ladybuggy/watermelony, nice and summery :)&lt;/p>

My friend Emma lent me her &lt;a href="http://www.modelsownit.com/nails/nail-art-pens.html" target="_blank">Models Own Nail Art Pen&lt;/a> in Black so I could have a play with it. I've never tried any of these pen style things before, so this is my first attempt :p So that's my reasoning as to why my lines are so wobbly! I found it had to be squeezed quite hard to get the varnish out, but I enjoyed using it and would love to try out different things with them.
&lt;p>For my nails I used Nails Inc&amp;rsquo;s Palace Gardens Terrace which is a lovely chocolatey brown, and then used the pen on top of it first doing 2 or 3 stripes then a chevron pattern on top. I think they&amp;rsquo;d look great in Autumn, they aren&amp;rsquo;t very summery like the weather we&amp;rsquo;ve been having recently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2650.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-476 aligncenter" title="chevron-nails" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2650-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
Ooh and look - my new ring :) This was one of the free things I got off eBay when they were giving away &lt;a title="Free £5 To Spend on eBay" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/free-5-to-spend-on-ebay/" target="_blank">free fivers&lt;/a>, it was only £1 inc p&amp;amp;p from Hong Kong. I think it's so cute!
&lt;p>Have you ever tried nail art pens? Any tips?&lt;/p>

Hope you&amp;rsquo;ve all had a lovely day :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed spending time doing no uni work at all :). Last week I had a test and 2 projects due in so I was working all day and night for all of that, so I decided this weekend would be a chilled out one! Friday night involved watching 3 hours of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108941/" target="_blank">The Stand&lt;/a>, Saturday was a crafty day and today was a beautiful sunny day so I went to town with my boyfriend for a wander and used my birthday vouchers to get a few goodies!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scrapbooking&lt;/strong>. On Saturday I continued on my scrapbook which is starting to get a lot bigger. I&amp;rsquo;m scrapping my trip to the US that me and my boyfriend took last summer, gives me holiday blues so much. I will blog about my scrapbook more when it&amp;rsquo;s finished. It&amp;rsquo;s my first attempt at making a scrapbook so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to some people&amp;rsquo;s, but I love this way of keeping my memories!  I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get the pages together first and then do the journaling after, so some pages are quite plain at the mo. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peak!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-400 aligncenter" title="Scrapbook Grand Canyon" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2582-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2584.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-399 aligncenter" title="Scrapbook Monument Valley" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2584-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">2. &lt;strong>Shopping&lt;/strong>. Today I used up most of my birthday vouchers and had a walk around Edinburgh in the sunshine. I managed to pick up the following, and I'm so excited by it all!&lt;/p>
[gallery link="file" order="DESC" orderby="post_date" exclude="400, 399"]
&lt;p>Look how cute those &lt;a href="http://www.paperchase.co.uk/pens-+amp-pencils/panda-highlighters-pack-of-5/invt/00485861/">panda highlighters&lt;/a> are?! I love Paperchase stationery, just wish it was a bit better for the budget. I got that 17 &lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/en/17-Fast-Finish-Nail-Polish_927316/" target="_blank">nail polish&lt;/a> from Boots in &amp;lsquo;Pink Lemonade&amp;rsquo;, will try it out tonight - looks lovely and fresh like summer! Went to The Works too and picked up a canvas for £2.99 - bargain!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then popped into Waterstones to use my book vouchers. I had looked online for some ideas before I went as I know I&amp;rsquo;d be in there for ages trying to decide between them all! Firstly I bought &lt;a href="http://www.sjwatson-books.com/beforeigotosleep/about/" target="_blank">Before I Go to Sleep&lt;/a> by S. J. Watson - &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Memories define us. So what if you lost yours every time you went to sleep?&lt;/em> An original, haunting, and deeply chilling debut.&amp;rdquo; I enjoy reading books like this and this one sounds particularly interesting, the boyfriend fancies having a read of this after me too. Then I bought &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0718157834" target="_blank">Me Before You&lt;/a> by Jojo Moyes - a girly book, don&amp;rsquo;t think the boyfriend will read this one :p. I wanted to also buy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pink-Hotel-Anna-Stothard/dp/1846881315" target="_blank">The Pink Hotel&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Into-Darkest-Corner-Elizabeth-Haynes/dp/0956251579/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1332094500&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Into the Darkest Corner&lt;/a>, but they&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have you been up to this weekend? Enjoying the sun where you are?&lt;/p>

Which is why I have taken so long to write a post on here as I&amp;rsquo;ve been so busy, but now I have a bit of time I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a post about it. Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank my boyfriend, family and friends for the lovely cards and gifts and for those that could make it out on the night!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a couple of weeks back my boyfriend asked me for some birthday ideas, and I found some jewellery that had been blogged about &lt;a href="http://sweetmondayblog.blogspot.com/">here&lt;/a> that I really wanted. Then when my birthday came and I opened my presents I was surprised to receive these two from him that I love :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly is a necklace from &lt;a href="http://www.wallpaperrose.bigcartel.com/">Wallpaper Rose&lt;/a> which is so cool as it  has a clock inside, and was prettily packaged with a bow. Wallpaper Rose is worth a look, I want more haha!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2333.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-139 aligncenter" title="IMGP2333" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2333-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2336.jpg">&lt;img class="wp-image-137" title="IMGP2336" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2336-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">Secondly was this cute little friendship bracelet from &lt;a href="http://lilyloveslola.bigcartel.com/">Lily Loves Lola&lt;/a>. I'd recommend this shop, there are lots of different bracelets all at a good price of just £2.50 each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2339.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138" title="IMGP2339" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2339-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">[hr]&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">The Saturday wasn't just my birthday, it was also 2 of my friends birthdays too. So we all went out to Hive (classy.. :/) but it's so cheap there and we always have a good time! So of course I had to do my nails :) I decided to paint them with Avon mirror shine in bronze, which I've owned for years but hardly worn, and Barry M black crackle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2351.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-140" title="IMGP2351" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2351-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2353.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-141" title="IMGP2353" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/IMGP2353-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">I like the way they turned out and matched my dress. My dress was from &lt;a href="http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&amp;amp;viewAllFlag&amp;amp;catalogId=33057&amp;amp;storeId=12556&amp;amp;productId=4212208&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;categoryId&amp;amp;searchTerm=SEQUIN|&amp;amp;pageSize=20&amp;amp;fb_source=message#13276692761531&amp;amp;country:undefined^language:undefined^currencySymbol:undefined^preferredUrl:undefined^siteLabel:undefined^langId:undefined^storeId:undefined^salesCatalogId:undefined^viewed:undefined^explicit:undefined" target="_blank">Topshop&lt;/a> and was only £15 in the sale, and although the sequins rubbed my arm a bit, I really liked it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/Dress.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-143" title="Dress" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/02/Dress-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">So that's my birthday done for a year and next up is Valentine's day, time is flying by! We managed to grab some Titanic 3D tickets for tomorrow and I am so glad I kept checking for them, be persistent and hope for cancellations if you want to see it. Hope you all have a lovely day filled with love and chocolate :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon and I have been in this flat in Edinburgh for just over 8 months now. And we love it! The high ceilings and big windows are my favourite and there&amp;rsquo;s so much space (we even have some empty cupboards/drawers still!).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I realised looking through these photos that I must have a thing for plants or I just like to take photos of them. The olive tree in our kitchen is my favourite of all. It&amp;rsquo;s from IKEA and it&amp;rsquo;s growing pretty fast with all the sunshine we&amp;rsquo;ve had lately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few photos I&amp;rsquo;ve taken recently from around our home.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The past 4 days I&amp;rsquo;ve spent spring cleaning the flat. I&amp;rsquo;ve cleared out so much stuff and made a little money selling a few things. I&amp;rsquo;ve rearranged the bedroom furniture and switched around shelving in the kitchen cupboards. It&amp;rsquo;s kept me busy whilst Jon&amp;rsquo;s been working, and since we are planning to move soon I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be a good time to get it done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the fresh feeling from decluttering. I bought a couple things to replace some old stuff too which is always fun to do! Jon sleeps better now that we have lovely new pillows which we picked out from TK Maxx. We spent 15 minutes in the shop opening bags and feeling each pillow before we decided which ones to buy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bought that aloe vera plant above from &lt;a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/60234647/" target="_blank">IKEA&lt;/a> to replace my cactus that died over winter (I left it by the window and I think it froze to death). It&amp;rsquo;s so cool that you can break off a tip and use the gel on burns (it&amp;rsquo;s even edible apparently!) and it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to care for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also planted those seedlings above 4 days ago and they shot up after just a day. They are organic phacelia seeds that I ordered for free from &lt;a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/supportus/keepbritainbuzzing" target="_blank">Keep Britain Buzzing&lt;/a>. I scattered over just a few of the seeds from the packet but I still overdid it! Bees go crazy for these plants, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to move it outdoors at some point. If our next place doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a garden I may just have to find somewhere to scatter the rest of the seeds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope you are having a great Friday!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They survived!! After 2 weeks away in Cardiff I came back to my flat to find my herbs hadn&amp;rsquo;t died. In fact, the soil from the chives and basil was still nice and moist. As you can see from the pics they aren&amp;rsquo;t looking too great though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The parsley in particular has gone quite wild. I wish I thinned that out earlier on since it&amp;rsquo;s all knotted together now. Not really sure what to do with the chives either. The basil on the other hand is looking fine, I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to thin it down to just one plant (moving the far right big one in to the middle of the pot) but then I might end up with nothing left&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As you can see they&amp;rsquo;re all still alive and growing :) I thinned the basil and parsley down quite a lot, I felt bad doing it but they were so overcrowded (the parsley&amp;rsquo;s still a bit wild). The parsley was pretty difficult as it&amp;rsquo;s become quite tangled but I managed to thin out about half of the seedlings. And now they are all starting to grow their second set of &amp;rsquo;true leaves'.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m off down to Cardiff tomorrow morning for the next two weeks, yay! I hope the herbs don&amp;rsquo;t all die by the time I get back though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Woah they&amp;rsquo;re growing quick! Especially the parsley, since &lt;a title="Seedlings" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/seedlings/">last week&lt;/a> there were only 3 measly seedlings there. The basil is starting to grow it&amp;rsquo;s first &amp;rsquo;true&amp;rsquo; leaves, which means I&amp;rsquo;ll have to thin them out soon - I&amp;rsquo;m scared it&amp;rsquo;ll result in them all dying though. Not really sure what to do with the chives either, any ideas? Tempted to just leave them grow but I don&amp;rsquo;t want them to kill each other?! Hmm we&amp;rsquo;ll see how they do for now!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yay! Some little seedlings have appeared a week after planting my &lt;a title="Grow Your Own Herbs" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/grow-your-own-herbs/">Gardener&amp;rsquo;s World Seeds&lt;/a>. The basil came up first and can already see I&amp;rsquo;ll have to do quite a bit of thinning with those. Only 3 of my parsley seeds have sprouted, but that&amp;rsquo;s better than none! The chives were the slowest to sprout, but now there are quite a few seedlings and they&amp;rsquo;re growing up fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll all keep on growing now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

So today my BBC Gardeners&amp;rsquo; World Herb Kit arrived. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to grow herbs on our windowsill for a while now, and getting the free voucher meant I could purchase some!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/herbkit.jpg">&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1085" title="herbkit" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/07/herbkit.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="205" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kit comes with Chive, Parsley and Basil seeds, compost, tray and these cool pots that you can write on with chalk. I sowed the seeds today and hopefully they will grow so we can use them. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Will post up on their progress after a week or so!&lt;/p>

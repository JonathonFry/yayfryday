&lt;p>Woah it&amp;rsquo;s been a while&amp;hellip; Jon and I moved in to our new flat almost 2 weeks ago and we&amp;rsquo;ve only just had the internet installed at the weekend. But hooray we are all settled in and have a long list of TV shows to catch up on! We both love our new place, the kitchen is so big and we made the most of it over the weekend when we had a flat warming - I baked ciabattas and we cooked tapas. And I made these cheesecakes. They were delicious. We had to fight over the last piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to make baked cheesecake for a while, and had a little look around for recipes and stumbled across &lt;a href="http://apumpkinandaprincess.com/2012/08/mini-snickers-cheesecakes.html" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> recipe for baked snickers cheesecakes (I totally copied the caramel sauce and chopped up snickers on top). I adapted it a little and made 2 versions (both with snickers) - Oreo base and Philadelphia, and Digestive base and Cadbury Philadelphia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t decide on my favourite&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/10/mini-baked-snickers-cheesecakes-2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997" alt="mini baked snickers cheesecakes (2)" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/10/mini-baked-snickers-cheesecakes-2.jpg" width="490" height="685" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I made them both:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mini Snickers Cheesecakes with Oreo Base&lt;/strong> &lt;em>(makes 6)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1/2 cup Oreos&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5 tbsp melted unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 egg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 snickers bar, chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>130g cream cheese&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp vanilla&lt;/li>
&lt;li>optional: caramel sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
1)  Preheat oven to 175C and line a muffin tray with 6 cupcake liners.
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Crush Oreos and mix with melted butter. Place 1 heaped tbsp in to each liner and flatten down to the bottom of the cases. Place muffin tray in the fridge whilst making the filling.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mix cream cheese and sugar together. Add the egg and vanilla, mixing until smooth. Fold in 1/2 the chopped snickers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fill the cupcake cups with the filling. Bake in the oven for 22 mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leave to cool completely (they sink down after a few minutes out of the oven). Remove the liners carefully, and top with the caramel sauce and the other 1/2 of the chopped snickers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mini Snickers Cheesecakes with Cadbury Philadelphia &lt;/strong>&lt;em>(makes 6)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1/2 cup digestives&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1.5 tbsp melted unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 egg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 snickers bar, chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>130g Cadbury Philadelphia&lt;/li>
&lt;li>optional: caramel sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
1)  Preheat oven to 175C and line a muffin tray with 6 cupcake liners.
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Crush digestives and mix with melted butter. Place 1 heaped tbsp in to each liner and flatten down to the bottom of the cases. Place muffin tray in the fridge whilst making the filling.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mix Cadbury Philadelphia and sugar together. Add the egg, mixing until smooth. Fold in 1/2 the chopped snickers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fill the cupcake cups with the filling. Bake in the oven for 22 mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leave to cool completely (they sink down after a few minutes out of the oven). Remove the liners carefully, and top with the caramel sauce and the other 1/2 of the chopped snickers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes: I was a bit scared of making bagels, with the boiling stage and shaping them I thought something would probably go wrong along the way. I kept to the recipe since it had so many good reviews, and the only part I had trouble with was getting the round shape right. But they&amp;rsquo;re almost there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: so chewy, &lt;em>so good&lt;/em>. I can see sweet cinnamon and raisin bagels being made with this recipe.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: Followed the recipe exactly. I used a hand whisk with dough hook attachments as Paul advises against using your hands because the dough is so sticky.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: Light and soft with a crisp crust - lovely. Great toasted, spreaded with hummus and topped with sausages for breakfast! Will definitely be baking more of these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today I baked these yummy iced lemon drizzle cupcakes as I had some lemons that needed using. I had roughly 115g of caster sugar left so I used that amount to judge how much other ingredients to use. I forgot that I&amp;rsquo;d need some more caster sugar for the drizzle but I used soft brown sugar instead and it tastes just as good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1903" alt="ldcupcake2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake2.jpg" width="490" height="323" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made 9 cupcakes from the mixture, and had a bit of icing leftover. I also threw in a handful of poppy seeds which adds a bit of texture. The sponge is lovely and moist, and the icing makes them that little bit more special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1901" alt="ldcupcake3" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/07/ldcupcake3.jpg" width="490" height="367" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the sponge:
115g caster sugar
115g self-raising flour
115g butter, softened
2 eggs
zest 1 lemon
handful of poppy seeds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the drizzle:
juice 1 lemon
60g brown sugar&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the icing:
zest and juice of 1 lemon
200g icing sugar&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Preheat oven to 160C. Beat together the butter and caster sugar until creamy, then slowly stir the eggs in one at a time. Add the flour, lemon zest and poppy seeds and mix together. Place the mixture in 9 cupcake cases and bake in the oven for 30mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make the lemon drizzle by mixing together the lemon and sugar. When the cupcakes are baked, remove them from the oven and prick them with a fork. Then spoon the drizzle over each cupcake and leave to cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once cooled, make the icing by combining the lemon zest and juice with the icing sugar until smooth. Pour over the cupcakes and leave to set. Enjoy!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>On the weekend I fancied something sweet and spotted a baked doughnut recipe from &lt;a href="http://www.krissys-creations.com/2011/06/baked-doughnuts.html" target="_blank">Krissy&amp;rsquo;s Creations&lt;/a> on Pinterest. Since I already had all the ingredients I went ahead and baked them. I&amp;rsquo;ve never made any type of doughnut before, but these were pretty easy to make and a lot healthier than fried ones. The doughnut holes remind me of mini iced buns!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/bakeddoughnut.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1653" alt="bakeddoughnut" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/04/bakeddoughnut.jpg" width="490" height="696" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>that&lt;/em> much like fried doughnuts in taste and texture, but they&amp;rsquo;re tasty regardless! And I think they look pretty cute too :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S. xo&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. I used a 2 inch and 3.5 inch round cutter to make the doughnut shapes and kept to &lt;a href="http://www.krissys-creations.com/2011/06/baked-doughnuts.html" target="_blank">the recipe&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lemon &amp; Poppy Seed Cupcakes</title><link>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/lemon-poppy-seed-cupcakes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2013 22:41:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://yayfrydayy.com/post/lemon-poppy-seed-cupcakes/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1553" alt="lemonpoppy" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy.jpg" width="490" height="652" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week whilst at university, there was a lady outside the student shop with a table filled with plates of cookies, flapjacks and muffins. She was giving them away for free to promote some new products they were launching in the shop. So I picked up a muffin, I had no idea what it was but it looked good. It turned out to be a lemon and poppy seed muffin and it was delicious! So I wanted to recreate that flavour, but instead of muffins I chose to make cupcakes with lemon buttercream icing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy2.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1556" alt="lemonpoppy2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppy2.jpg" width="490" height="693" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed the BBC GoodFood&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/470636/lemon-and-poppyseed-cupcakes" target="_blank">lemon and poppyseed cupcakes recipe&lt;/a> to make 12 cupcakes, although I halved the icing quantity (so glad I did!) but still used the juice of one lemon. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t bother toasting the poppy seeds, I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what difference that would make? The end result is yummy nevertheless! I love the texture with the poppy seeds and the zing of lemon is so good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think they would still be tasty without the icing if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something with less sugar (and butter!) or maybe instead of buttercream making a lemon drizzle topping instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppybite.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1550" alt="lemonpoppybite" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/lemonpoppybite.jpg" width="490" height="346" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Sunday I baked myself a birthday cake. I was really in the mood to bake something and it was my birthday the next day so I thought why not! It&amp;rsquo;s oh so chocolatey and delicious, just the way I like :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did cheat and buy a box mix (Betty Crocker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.bettycrocker.co.uk/Our-Products/Cake-Mixes/Devils-Food-Cake" target="_blank">Devil&amp;rsquo;s Food Cake&lt;/a>) because I wanted to give it a go and be a bit lazy. But I did make the frosting from scratch and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing! I followed the recipe for nutella cloud frosting from &lt;a href="http://sweetapolita.com/2012/03/chocolate-birthday-cupcakes-with-nutella-cloud-frosting/" target="_blank">Sweetapolita&lt;/a>, and it really does have an airy cloud-like texture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s see how long this cake will last&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Notes: I made 12 breadsticks as stated in the recipe, each 25cm long. I shaped half of them into twists and used chilli salt, black pepper, poppy seeds and sea salt as toppings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Review: They&amp;rsquo;re great for dipping, but I found them quite chewy on their own. I also would have preferred them to be thinner, perhaps by dividing the dough into more sticks or making extra long ones. The chilli salt ones were my favourite.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I did end up making cheescakes using the new Philadelphia with Cadbury, and they are so yum!!  They are so quick and easy to make, and the philadelphia alone is really nice which I found surprising as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what it would be like. You could just spread it on a digestive and you&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much got a tasty cheesecake already. But I decided to go ahead and make the cheesecakes featured on the Philadelphia website &lt;a href="http://www.philadelphia.co.uk/philadelphia3/page?locale=uken1&amp;amp;PagecRef=609&amp;amp;rid=40107&amp;amp;fb_source=message" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2545.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-380 aligncenter" title="IMGP2545" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2545-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-align: center;">75 g light digestive biscuits (I used 4.5 biscuits)&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">20 g butter, melted&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">160 g Philadelphia with Cadbury&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">180 g double cream&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="text-align: center;">20 g icing sugar&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
Firstly to make the base just bash up the biscuits in to crumbs and mix with the melted butter. Place the mix in to 5 ring moulds (6-7cm) or ramekins or maybe just make one big cheesecake, and place in the fridge. Then in a bowl whisk together the Philadelphia with Cadbury (the tub is 160g so use it all), double cream and icing sugar. Once it's all mixed together and looking good (have a taste ;)), place it on to the cheesecake bases and spread it all over the top, then return them to the fridge for a couple of hours to set. You could add whatever you'd like to the philly mixture, like fudge pieces or chocolate chips, to make it even better!
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2565.jpg">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-387 aligncenter" title="IMGP2565" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2012/03/IMGP2565-300x218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
They make just the right sized cheesecakes, perfect. The Philadelphia is currently on offer at Asda for £1 for a 160g tub. Let me know if you make any, or have tried the Cadbury Philadelphia!

I decided to follow a recipe from the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baking-Made-Easy-Lorraine-Pascale/dp/0007275943" target="_blank">Baking Made Easy&lt;/a> by Lorraine Pascale. I thought the recipe was good, but only if you are making very large cupcakes or more than than 12! Even though the recipe states that it makes 12, the cases were overfilled and there was so much buttercream!! Got enough for 12 more cakes leftover, and cut the peaks off the cakes which were eaten very quickly.&lt;/p>

I tried out my &lt;a title="New Icing Bag Set" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/tala-icing-bag-set/">Tala icing bag&lt;/a> too, and it was really good! The buttercream was sooo stiff though, I'll try a different recipe next time, so the icing didn't come out so good because of this as my hand was hurting :/ But they tasted good and that's the main thing! I used coloured shimmer sugar in pink and blue to match the cases and make them look pretty.

I wonder how long they'll last...! Any recommendations of good recipes for buttercream?

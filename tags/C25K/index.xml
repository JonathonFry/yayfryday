&lt;p>Begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then 28 minutes of running.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">It's week 8 and I've fallen behind! Run 1 continued from week 7,  Run 2 was 11 days later and Run 3 was urm... 3 months later. We went away to Poland and then didn't get back in to it (when Jon started work) until now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 8 Run 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Monday / Union Canal / sun
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments:&lt;/strong> Ran for 28 mins yay! Felt tired at around the halfway mark but kept on going and started to feel better again towards the end. It was quiet out since it&amp;rsquo;s a bank holiday which was nice as we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to keep checking behind and moving out of the way for cyclists. Only 5 more runs and we&amp;rsquo;ll have completed C25K!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 8 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Friday / Union Canal / sun
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>So it&amp;rsquo;s been 11 days since my last run. With going to the Lake District, Alton Towers and Cardiff over the past week we didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to fit in any running. We are going away to Poland on Wednesday and then it&amp;rsquo;ll be another week till we&amp;rsquo;re back. Anyway, I thought this run would be a struggle after the break but it actually went really well. We started off a lot slower than usual and Jon had a bad stitch for the first half of the run, but we were able to speed up in the second half and end with some energy still left over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 8 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W8R3ib.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1988" alt="W8R3ib" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W8R3ib.jpg" width="490" height="491" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Holyrood Park / dry&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 3 months since Run 2. I think when we are both working full-time evening runs will work best. We decided to run around Holyrood Park, doing the popular 5K route around Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat. Never done this run before with up and downhills. We decided to just pick up from where we left and hoped we still had it in us. The uphill was hard but once we were on the flat and it started to turn downhill it was great. Although at just under 3miles my hip started to hurt pretty bad. Hope it gets better soon and just needs a little rest. We both really enjoyed the run in the evening, it was quiet and felt cooler. Hooray for finishing week 8 finally!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s week 7 and still enjoying it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 7 Run 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Union Canal / sun
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We tried a new route today straight from our flat and onto the canal from there. It felt great to have a change of scenery and it made it seem like a shorter distance that way. It also felt easier than the last run. Although very red faced by the end of it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 7 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
 &lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W7R2ib.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1751" alt="W7R2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/05/W7R2ib.jpg" width="490" height="490" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Wednesday / Union Canal / wind and rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today we had to run a day later than we should have because Jon had exams Monday and Tuesday. I think that made this run harder, as we were both feeling it in our legs today! I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying seeing our progress on the nike+ app, with graphs of our pace etc and how much we&amp;rsquo;ve improved since the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 7 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Union Canal / sun&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Again we&amp;rsquo;ve had to wait 3 days till this run, exams getting in the way! All finished now though so we can get back into a better routine. Think we are going to stick with running straight from our flat too, now that we are more confident. Still felt pretty tired at the end of the run. The nike+ app told us we&amp;rsquo;d completed 5k in 32'40&amp;quot;, which would&amp;rsquo;ve included some of the walking. I hope by the end of week 9 we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do 5k running in 30 mins, but even to run 5k straight shall be an accomplishment! :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Union Canal / sun&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I&amp;rsquo;d heard some people say that this run is a struggle. After doing the 20 min run it seems like this one will be fine, but that confidence can mean running faster and lead to getting tired quicker. So I made sure to keep it steady and start off slowly, and it went really well. This run was the farthest and quickest of them all that we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded on the nike+ app, getting closer to that 5k!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;strong>Week 6 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Tuesday / Union Canal / windy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>On Monday I had my first exam in the morning, so instead we went for a run the next day. It was really windy and it made it quite hard to run on the way out. At around the halfway mark I had a bad stitch which made it a struggle and I felt so tired at the end of it. It makes me nervous for the 25 min run that&amp;rsquo;s coming next!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>It rained today so no nike+. It started off really well, but between 12.5 and 20 mins was the hardest. We kept at a steady pace throughout and pushed through it. Felt good afterwards, and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome to think that 6 weeks ago we were running a minute at a time. Only 3 weeks to go, and no more walking between runs from here on!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Week 5 already, it&amp;rsquo;s going by so quick. The sun was out today and there were quite a few people along the canal. We passed a lady taking close up photos of something on the ground, and later realised it was probably of newts as we noticed them along the path and made sure not to step on any! I felt quite tired after this run, but I can feel my cardio has improved from week 1 for sure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Monday / Union Canal / windy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>The wind has been so bad these last couple days and it continued today. It made it difficult for our run out but helped with the run back. It was 2 runs of 8 mins each which felt good as after 1 run there was only one more to go! At the end of the run we both felt we had energy to keep going. I love how these runs are breaking up revision, always looking forward to the next one. I&amp;rsquo;m nervous for the next one though as there won&amp;rsquo;t be any walking in between, Jon thinks it&amp;rsquo;ll be fine though so we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Wednesday / Union Canal / rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We did it!! It rained heavily all the way through the run. I had my rainproof coat on with hood up which kept most of the rain off me. Jon&amp;rsquo;s coat isn&amp;rsquo;t waterproof so he had it worse, but regardless of the rain we did the full 20 mins! It actually felt really good. I was worried I would struggle but once we started and got into a rhythm, I felt like I could keep on going. Jon didn&amp;rsquo;t take his phone with the nike+ app on because of the rain (both of our pockets were soaked through after) so we don&amp;rsquo;t know how we did for pace etc, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how next week goes!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Our first 5 min run today. The sun was out and we actually took our gloves off halfway as we started to sweat. Felt really good after the run, and pleased with the progress and improvement since week one. Also, the daffodils are finally coming out!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Out early this morning as we had to park at a pay &amp;amp; display spot last night as there were no spaces left so the car needed moving. Along the canal there were lots of kids and parents doing the school run and commuters cycling so we had to run in single file most of the time. Both of our legs were still aching after we &lt;a title="Walking in the Pentlands" href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/2013/04/08/walking-in-the-pentlands/">walked in the Pentlands&lt;/a> on Saturday, so we struggled a bit to keep them moving.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / clouds&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Nice and quiet along the canal today. Found this run quite hard, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because for the Thursday runs we always have 2 days of rest before it. I had a stitch on the final run and found it really hard to keep running but I was determined not to stop and made it. I&amp;rsquo;m quite nervous for next week as it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;rsquo;transitional&amp;rsquo; week which transitions from running mixed with walking to just running. Should be able to run 20 mins non-stop by the end of the week. Will see how that goes!&lt;/p>

&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 3 Run 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Holyrood Park / light snow&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today we went for a drive to Holyrood Park for our run and left a little later than usual. I had cereal when I woke up and it was around an hour later we went for the run. So I had a bad stitch during the first run, and when it came to the 3 min run I was really struggling but kept going. Jon thought I was going to cry..! So we paused the podcast after the run for a minute whilst I tried to get rid of it, and when it calmed down we carried on. We decided to try a different route and ended up running up a very steep muddy hill, but by the time we were up my stitch was gone and I had a sudden rush of energy. We were both very tired after and I think from now on I won&amp;rsquo;t eat breakfast until we get back home, and we won&amp;rsquo;t be doing that route again until we are fitter!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 3 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: left;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W3R2ib.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1626" alt="w3r2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W3R2ib.jpg" width="490" height="490" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Monday / Union Canal / cloudy
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I didn&amp;rsquo;t eat breakfast before we went out today but took a banana with me for after the run (we are usually up at 8 and out around 8.45ish). We both felt a lot better this time and felt we could keep going on for longer. We noticed that this week takes less time than the previous weeks, and we cover 3.5km compared to 4.1km previously. Excited for the next run!&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 3 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / sun and clouds
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Today felt warmer as the sun kept peeking out. Sticking with the not eating until we get home which is working out well. We ran alongside a kayak and a canal boat which was cool. Again we felt like we could run more, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how we feel about that next week with the longer runs..!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Saturday / Union Canal / overcast&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>It was very cold today (as usual)! Ran along the canal again, this time there were a couple rowing boats out which was quite funny as during the walking parts they would overtake us and then the running parts we would overtake them. Jon used his headphones too whilst using the nike+ app which was cool because it let us know whenever we&amp;rsquo;d run a mile. Felt good during/after the run and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Monday / Union Canal / light snow&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>We both felt tired today, but we motivated each other to keep on going and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad we did. Uni is stressful at the moment (Dissertation due on Thurs!) but we are both finding that running is helping de-stress us and gets us away from a computer and in to the fresh air which can only be a good thing :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>I was worried it would be slippy out today but luckily the path along the canal had been cleared. Today was probably the least windy it&amp;rsquo;s been since we began and that definitely helped with the running, the sun even came out at one point! Ran a bit further along the canal until we were on an aqueduct that runs over the Water of Leith. We did a sprint finish on the last run, which tired us both out after! On to week 3&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jon and I have begun to run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been into running, whenever I went for a run I&amp;rsquo;d come home and feel so tired that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to go again! I think that made me not enjoy it - pushing myself too hard and feeling defeated. I think the last time I went out for a run was 2 years ago. Then, last week Jon and I were talking about fitness and how we want to get fitter but we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough money to go to a leisure centre blah blah. We enjoy hill walking but that&amp;rsquo;s more of a weekend thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We talked about running and looked at the &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/LiveWell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k.aspx" target="_blank">Couch to 5k plan&lt;/a> that we&amp;rsquo;d heard good things about before but never properly looked into it. The 9-week plan slowly eases you into running, where you begin by mixing running and walking together and slowly build up to running a 5k. And then we decided to do it. 2 days later I bought some budget running shoes and the next day we went for our first run.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Begin with a brisk 5-minute walk, then alternate 60 seconds of running and 90 seconds of walking, for a total of 20 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Sunday / Holyrood Park / rain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Actually ran week 2 run 1. I accidentally put the wrong podcast on my iPod.. oops. But got through it and felt good afterwards, without feeling like my body was melting :) My left heel rubbed a bit in my new shoes, think it&amp;rsquo;s just from wearing them in though. We are both looking forward to our next run!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. the next 2 days both of our legs ached haha we need to keep it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 2:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R2.jpg">&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1571 aligncenter" alt="W1R2" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R2.jpg" width="374" height="498" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Tuesday / Holyrood Park / snow &amp;amp; wind
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Back on to Week 1 as I&amp;rsquo;ve sorted my iPod out now! The weather was really bad, strong winds and snow made this feel like such a workout. My hands were numb and it felt like I was running backwards when the wind was against me as I was running up a slight incline. Apparently there was a weather warning, but it made it a challenge and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did it! After coming home and having a warm shower it was worth it :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Week 1 Run 3:&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;a href="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R3.jpg">&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1572" alt="Camera 360" src="http://sweetaspi.co.uk/images/2013/03/W1R3.jpg" width="490" height="653" />&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When / Where / Weather:&lt;/strong> Thursday / Union Canal / sunshine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comments: &lt;/strong>Yay the sun came out, although it&amp;rsquo;s still cold around 1°C it felt so much warmer. We tried a different route closer to our flat, it was more sheltered and we both really enjoyed it. Also saw signs that spring is almost here - can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it to get warmer. I felt this run was a lot easier than the last 2, that&amp;rsquo;s probably mainly due to the weather but hopefully I am getting fitter too! Both excited to start week 2 over the weekend!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Do you run? Have you ever tried the C25K plan or similar? &lt;/em>&lt;/p>
